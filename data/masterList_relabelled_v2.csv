We went to Marmaris with my wife for a holiday. We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..,0
During my holiday in Marmaris we ate here to fit the food. It's really good that the food is cheap and nice. Eating as much bread as you want is a big plus for those who are not satisfied without bread. It is a place that I can recommend to those who will go to Marmaris. On July 1 there was a small increase but even the price hike is cheap. I leave the photo of the latest prices and breakfast below. there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..,0
Prices are very affordable. The menu in the photo cost 108 liras. You have to wait 10-15 minutes for food. Staff is annoying. Well it tastes good. Boiled meat was delicious.,0
Turkey's cheapest artisan restaurant and its food is delicious!,0
I don't know what you will look for in terms of price performance point; taste; but yigit restaurant writes a big plus for those who come to work in this region.,0
What you see is 125 TL in total. It's a pretty convenient place. We can say that it is an artisan restaurant; you should not expect a restaurant; but they are still quite good in terms of price and performance. As of July 1; prices will increase,0
Delicious food at rock bottom prices. Friendly staff; Highly recommend,0
"Every time I go, I still experience the amazement I experienced years ago as if it were the first time. There is no need to explain. Folk hero is a business.",0
The most f/p of all businesses I've seen.,0
The food was just like the ones my mother made. Prices were reasonable.,0
The ambiance of the place is nice; when we went; there was a lot of queue; and after waiting for a while; they took our place. The friend who took our order said half a half pizza and we preferred half chicken and half steak. Two people were easily satisfied; a lot of patterns.,0
"Flavor : It has nothing but dough taste. Labor : Not befitting a touristic place. Service : There was no wet wipes and napkins on the table, but there was no sympathetic family to say. This service and this taste were not available at this price.",0
It is in the center; easy to reach; close to the parking lot; the prices are partially affordable; the products are delicious but not quite satisfying; the seating places are cramped; the place is a little flat.,0
They make delicious pizza with nice ingredients on thin dough. Slice pizza and all pizza options are available. You can try two different flavors as a whole by making two different choices for the whole pizza. We wanted the mushroom and sausage. It was very nice; warm; and it was cooked in its consistency without drying the ingredients.,0
It's in a nice place but it's very small and their pizza is not that good to be exaggerated. Pizza dough is nice and thin. They do not offer advice to the customer.,0
I strongly recommend. If I come to the taste part; it was very enjoyable to eat with their special sauces. Also the whole pizza was huge.,0
It is very tasty; similar to Italian pizzas. Roast beef and mohair 180 TL; other pizzas 150 TL. An adult male eats 6 slices; pizzas are one size and 8 slices.,0
Do not come around Marmaris and do not leave without eating pizza at Pizza Fellas. We ate mixed pizza; they can make two types of pizza. So delicious!,0
I never thought that the best pizza I've ever eaten would be in Akyaka. Thin pizzas are very tasty and the options are very good. We recommend it to everyone who comes to Akyaka.,0
It was as if a very delicious Italian chef had come out of his hands. You can eat with pleasure. The owners are very good people. I recommend.,0
The pizza is big enough for 2 people. The dough is very thin. Price is between 120-140 TL.,0
The environment; the interest and friendliness of the employees; the taste is incredible. It is so beautiful inside that you do not prefer to sit at the bottom of the sea. Depending on the day; there are also things that are not written on the menu; be sure to check it out. Hours have passed since the meal; we are still talking about the beef brisket.,0
Pizza is delicious.. I can say it is one of the rare tastes. Prices are in the 200-300 range and one pizza is more than enough for two people if you are not very hungry. The scenery is already gorgeous.,0
The vegan breakfast made me extremely happy. It was nice.,0
Whatever we ate was good. The Italian Restaurant is the first thing that comes to mind; apart from pizza and pasta; ciger yahni was successful; purslane salad; presentations are successful. Taste point in Datca.,0
Very enjoyable beautiful place. Pizza salad food taste is great.,0
Its breakfast is more satisfying than the places around it.,0
Nice intimate restaurant. Good service. Eye for detail. Clean. Really good food; well presented.,0
The food is delicious but a little pricey. The best Cappucino in DatÃ§a is here..,0
It's a very delicious; beautiful small business; but the appointment is a bit difficult to find; the pizzas are great Cafe Inn pizza and a wonderful 4 cheese and brownie as dessert. Thank you for your good wishes.,0
When I went; I waited for almost 20 minutes for the waiters to take care of me. The taste was not bad. The surrounding was beautiful.,0
"It is a very, very expensive place. It took 30 minutes for 2 drinks to arrive.",0
I had the creamy chicken vegetable stew. It tasted excellent. It was quite satisfying. The environment is beautiful and spacious.,0
quality service and rich menu. the attitude of the staff is really excellent. A business that deserves 5 stars.,0
The sushi was too small so it was not possible to taste the ingredients; the rice was overcooked and lacked flavor; it was missing except for the tail of the shrimp.,0
The staff was very engaged. Service and taste were perfect.,0
Perfect location next to the sea. Music; light in the evening lounge atmosphere. In short; everything is beautiful.,0
"It was very expensive, but taste wasn't bad.",0
Good quality service; nice customer service; they are happy to help with a smile.,0
Scrambled eggs with casserole and toast waited 30 minutes. At 12:30pm the main menu was denied and showed only breakfast available. Prices are much higher than other places.,0
"Nice view, good staff, clean place and nice atmosphere.",0
Nice food and good service; located just near the beach as well.,0
It was very nice to be greeted with a smile when we first entered; we went with my wife; the services are very fast; the empty services are removed immediately; the washbasins were hygienic and clean; and I would recommend a very reasonable place.,0
Kebabs are good; trotters are good; desserts are good. Actually; the decor part of the atmosphere is good. Only a lot of noise comes from the kitchen part. Employees are smiling.,0
If you come to Antep; sit down and taste the Beyran soup; served plain and with garlic.,0
I asked for garlic; but I had a hard time getting the taste of the meat from the garlic flavor. I'll try again with little or no garlic. Quite satisfying. I like the taste too; you should definitely try it.,0
Taste was amazing! Price was not high.,0
When I ate it in the past; it tasted very good; I think the chef has changed. The atmosphere was average.,0
We were very satisfied. I strongly recommend trying it. Delicious appetizers come with the meals.,0
The food tastes good. The atmosphere of the place was not very attractive.,0
We ate 1 mumbar and 1 kusleme and paid 310 TL. The meals were very tasty.,0
Very cheap and delicious!,0
Ayran came when the meal was over; the food was very bitter.,0
Although the prices are a little high; the quality is high so it does not disappoint. The taste was very good; well done!,0
We ordered Etli Ali Nazik Kebab. They said he was the most famous. We ate meat with yogurt. The food was cold.,0
We came because it is a very famous place. They had really delicious food.,0
Ali nazik was 240 tl lahmacun 50 tl even tea with a fee of 5 tl. We visited so many places; this was the most expensive.,0
The taste was very good but the prices were also very high.,0
Located in Gaziantep historical bazaar; the place stands out with its beautiful and spacious ambiance. I liked the place very much; we came for dessert after dinner.,0
I had the chance to taste many flavors; all of them were very good; I was amazed by Ali Nazik Kebab.,0
The restaurant that made our four-day Gaziantep holiday poison! There is already excessive noise; it is impossible to hear the person next to you. The waiters are indifferent; the order takes too long to arrive.,0
"They sold us rotten pistachios, it sucks!",0
I don't know why we ate here despite the exorbitant prices. A portion of kebab or sis meat product starts from 220 TL as of the end of June 2023. Naturally; you expect a good portion; but a tiny portion in the middle of the plate.,0
"A great business that does not compromise on its taste; lahmacun, garlic kebab; yoghurt kebab; the smile of the waiters; everything is in place; thank you very much for the nice service and delicious food.",0
The breakfast was very good; I recommend it; the presentations were also eye-catching. We paid 240tl for the table you see in the photo; including 6 teas and 2 Turkish coffees.,0
The place is beautiful. The staff was very nice. We asked for tiramisu. It was very fresh and beautiful.,0
Beautiful place. The breakfast is said to be good. I had tea in the evening; it was delicious. It tastes like a samovar. The environment is calm. The music is jazz style; suitable for the calm and soft atmosphere.,0
Hookah and ambiance is super!,0
They have a problem with the service; but if you're going to drink tea; they do it well. Your tea is always hot over the fire.,0
Some of the coffee I wanted came spilled; the coffee tasted dry. Also; my wife's order was wrong.,0
Lovely; affordable seafront spot to while away the afternoon smoking nargile and playing backgammon (tavla). Super hospitable employees and enjoyable ambience.,0
A cheap and delicious place. If you are passing by; you should not continue without having a cup of tea.,0
Seaside great view!,2
Prices are nice,2
Bitter; mango; Bodrum tangerine; honey almond; Big Babas; mastic gum; walnut; blackberry and forest fruit definitely recommend..,0
The prices are cheap from the center; the ice cream is legendary; don't miss out; it's worth waiting in line; it's the best ice cream shop in Fethiye. Real milk ice cream,0
Absolutely perfect come try it..,0
Terrible. This is a lie. This is not ice cream! This gum is an ice cream substitute.,0
As I was crossing the road; I noticed that we stopped. The light ad is very good because everything has ice cream icons. The only normal price I've seen in Fethiye is 6 TL.,0
The atmosphere of the place was nice; if you want to taste the ice creams; I can say that it is an ordinary ice cream that you can eat anywhere.,0
It literally gave me the feeling of chewing sugar. It's not even about ice cream.,0
We visited with my friends. The lemon one was great!,0
A great taste. I went on recommendation; it was really true. I also recommend it to you.,0
Their prices are very reasonable and their ice creams are delicious. There is not only ice cream but also dessert sales inside. There are many options for ice cream; which is a very nice detail.,0
On the way to the city center of Fethiye; a sweet place caught our attention. The ice cream cone-shaped totem on the road was very original.,0
The hamburger bread was very nice. I didn't like his meatballs very much.Orders are coming out very quickly; and the working friends are very kind; thank you.,0
A place that makes unorthodox burgers in Samsun. The hamburger bread is big and wide with lots of sesame seeds.,0
It's a very nice place; the hamburger is very nice. The staff is very good; there is a children's playground,0
The place is nice; the waiters work sulkily. The location; service and presentation are beautiful. And his hamburger might be the most mediocre hamburger I've ever had. There is no meat taste in the meatball.,0
Mushroom burger the meat stays thin inside the huge burger bread; and the meat and mushrooms do not stay in the bread because of the sauce applied on the bread.,0
They have really saturated menus. The prices are very good; and as a place with a very nice interior and exterior decor with sea views; I would definitely recommend it at the same time.,0
I never liked the service very bad; when we brought the wrong burger and returned it; we had to wait that much longer. The potatoes were terrible; the only onion rings and mushrooms were beautiful. I will never go to this place again.,0
The burger is successful; but the service is very slow; I came to the place 2 times; they bring the order incorrectly.,0
The menu content is beautifully varied and satisfying.,0
The price was not right; I bought a 2-piece menu; the burger and bread did not taste good.,0
The prices were generally reasonable; the tastes were also good enough.,0
The menus offered by the friendly staff are something else; the flavors we have tasted.,0
"I would like to thank the service in Fethiye branch and especially Mr. Samet; the official here, for his interest and relevance.",0
The menu is incomplete; not much; usually a disaster with happy sweet toys; felt-tip pens and a few cardboard coloring pages.,0
Taste is exactly the same as in classic hamburgers; prices are extra high.,0
Every time I come to Fethiye; I stop by and fill my stomach with pleasure.,0
In general; everything was good; but the tables were not collected during the 35-45 minutes I was there. It was messy inside.,0
The ambiance of the place looks a bit old.,0
They are very fast and the food tastes good too.,0
The potatoes were almost dead and tasteless.,0
I didn't like the gloomy; dark atmosphere of the environment; the toilets are dirty; you are disgusted to wash your hands.,0
There was a hair in the fries; disgusting.,0
In terms of price; it is above Marmaris prices. In other words; there are menus with prices above the average. I was satisfied with almost everything I ate and drank.,0
It is a place where the food is as amazing as the cocktails. The sole fish was very good. employees are very engaged.,0
"Slagethi all nero was excellent. Beef ribs were always tender enough. Cheek, on the other hand; has preserved its taste even though its collection is a little small. If deterioration was to come; the services were passed and the environment was much expected.",0
As we were passing on the road; it was pleasing to our eyes and we dived in. It was good overall.,0
For people living in Marmaris; it is a beautiful place to visit in summer and winter. I recommend you to try liver because they serve it in a way I have never tried before and because of its amazing taste.,0
Wonderful place where you can go with your family and have fun; nice place with live music...,0
Prices were slightly higher than peers.,0
Pukka is a restaurant by the sea where you will have the most beautiful pictures and videos where you can organize a nice organization in Marmaris.,0
Great concept and very tasty food.,0
Popular place for Winter and Summer; food and drink menu wide enough and delicious.,0
Delicious. However; prices are as high as Marmaris in general in 2021.,0
The interior design is simple and pleasant; with balconies and upper floors with sea views.,0
"I can say that my worst flat white experience. ""Would you like milk?"" they said. I drank more milk than coffee.",0
A great starbucks branch located in Bodrum center / bazaar / port. It's great because the layout; the environment; the place and the service are very successful.,0
The place is very narrow; I can say it's the worst starbucks I've ever seen.,0
It was a pleasant snack; a refreshing drink in hot weather.,0
"The view is super, the cleanliness is bad, the location is very good",0
The place is so sweet. but it gets too crowded in the evenings.,0
Familiar coffee that I taste,0
Had to stop by for a take out coffee during the morning hours.,0
Employees are very warm. in a very pleasant location.,0
The employees are very good and caring. Best Starbucks..,0
Here you can find by far the best 4-cheese pizza you can eat in Bodrum. On top of that; you may have reasons to come back again and again with the unusual taste and presentation of the magnolia.,0
A place we found by chance during the winter season. First of all; we sat down to drink coffee and the environment was so spacious and calm that I was able to hold a meeting that I had to do over the web without any problems.,0
I have never seen a pizza with such a thin pizza dough that the material did not fall apart. Pizza mista is a great choice for mixed lovers.,0
It is a very nice place to watch the matches; when it is closed in winter.,0
A pleasant place with a beach; delicious food,0
It is a place where you can both enter at home and spend time with pleasure and eat and drink. The beach is very beautiful; your sea is clean. The food is also very good.,0
It is a business that serves 2 orange juices that are not on the breakfast menu and that I did not order; as if they were on the menu; and charges an extra 40 TL.,0
We sat at the table; 10m away from the water; went for a swim and then came back to our table. They have changing cabins inside; very clean. Tried some cocktails and they were really good; but prices are like in Kos; Greece where we came from.,0
It is a restaurant-bar with an extraordinary ambiance. It has an excellent location on Bodrum Beach. The service is top notch and leaves nothing to be desired.,0
Seaside; pleasant place; mediocre food; owners concerned.,0
Beautifully located restaurant on the beach; very nice staff and very good value for money; would gladly come again.,0
Nice place with a view. Not bad in terms of food but ordinary.,0
A place where you pay for the view. In general; although the breakfast is good; 80tl per person for two people 160tl is a bit high.,0
It has a location by the sea; a layout that allows for indoor and outdoor seating. Their waiters are nervous and sometimes indifferent.,0
It was very nice that the food was delicious; the place was facing the beauty of Alanya Castle and especially all the staff were interested.,0
Good salep was good; the employees were smiling..,0
Food was tasteless. The waiters were not smiling at all.,0
We wanted mint lemonade; they put mint syrup in the lemonade; when we asked; they said that's what we do; but if you don't like it; we'll change it and they changed it.,0
A large spacious place. If you want; you can relax inside and have something to drink.,0
Location is nice. We love it as a family. Pizza was delicious.,0
Stylish; decent and clean place. I advise.,0
In a beautiful location by the sea; sometimes it gets very crowded; the service can be delayed,0
I think it came with a change in taste with the price update.,0
It's nice; but it's very late. I place an order; it arrives an hour later; I would be happy if it was a little faster.,0
A delicious doner.,2
the ambiance was nice.,0
Interest was good; but doner was a complete disaster. First of all; it came cold; there was no proper sauce in it; there was so much onion that I could not taste the meat at all.,0
"Delicious doner. I went there with my friend, that was she's first. She liked too.",0
"Nice place, good price; good quality",0
It was one of the best doner I've ever eaten in my life. Thank you very much.,0
There were problems with cleaning. Chefs must wear gloves.,0
The atmosphere is very nice; the flavors are also very good; but the prices are a bit high.,0
We went for breakfast in the morning; the atmosphere is nice. breakfast items were good and tasty.,0
The cafe was cheap enough; I ate with my family.,0
We ordered breakfast; the table was full. It was truly fascinating. I advise.,0
The indoor atmosphere was nice; but I can't say the same for the outdoor,0
We were very satisfied from the staff to the meal.,0
Ambiance was good.,2
Clean business; I liked it.,0
They didn't care about us when we went.,0
The restaurant is well located and above all it is nicely decorated and clean.,0
Good quality drinks and food.,0
Good location; no parking problem. The business is a little small. The products are considered good.. I didn't like the SakarasÄ± dessert very much. Meat skewer and knife were not bad. Prices are normal..,0
Employees are kind. Food is delicious,0
The okra soup was hot and scrumptious to the broth. The meat loaf and tandoori kebab were excellent. We ate in the garden with pleasure in a cool weather.,0
One of my favorite places in Konya in terms of service; hygiene and taste.,0
It is one of the rare places where I can taste the Etli Ekmek I ate in my childhood.,0
My wife and I liked the meat loaf very well; as the distance between the knives is very good. The downside was that there weren't enough toilets; we waited in line.,0
I had heard that meatloaf was good; but the taste was not that praiseworthy.,0
The food is delicious; but the portions are very small and the prices are so high.,0
Waiters were better than Meram branch. Although the taste of Etliekmek is not very good; you can easily bring your guests from outside the city.,0
Prices are high; even for the yogurt we didn't order; we were charged.,0
Service is very slow. The ayran comes in advance; neither foam remains nor we saw here for the first time that buttermilk is paid.,0
The atmosphere of the place and the interest of the waiters were good. Food came fast and hot. We ordered spicy tabokki; it wasn't bitter; it tasted very good. We ordered cheese kimbab and it had cheddar in it. I don't recommend it to those who don't like seaweed.,0
"Atmosphere of the restourant was amazing, I felt times that I in Korea",0
The products were delicious; the service was fast; the employees were smiling and interested. Bulgogi mildly spiced meat was delicious.,0
We had very high expectations; but unfortunately we did not like it. Chicken was very sweet. Prices are not too high. You wait in line outside.,0
It was really nice; I liked it very much. Moreover; the prices are quite normal. Well done to everyone who worked there.,0
Kimbap wasn't for me; it's a tough flavor.,0
I don't know much about Korean cuisine; but I have tasted it. Chicken with soy sauce was cooked to a great consistency and served warm.,0
I had been to a different Korean restaurant before; the ambiance there really made me feel like I was in Korea. I couldn't feel that feeling here.,0
foods are good. but the environment and service is not a full korean experience.,0
Super taste; best rose rabokki I've ever eaten in my life. At the same time; we ordered a gimbap with kimchi; and we think it suits them very well.,0
A nice place where you can taste examples of Korean cuisine. The closest taste to Turkish cuisine on the menu. Traditional chicken. Prices are very reasonable.,0
The flavor that I ate as a child is here; but there were many queues; as in all parts of Istanbul.,0
Patso starts from 50tl. It comes with lots of potatoes in the bread wrapped in paper; dipped in ketchup or mayonnaise according to your needs. You have to eat standing up. It does not have a special flavor; but it is satisfying,0
There was no place to sit and eat; we ate standing. It tasted good.,0
I have never eaten such a delicious patso until now. Recommended guys. And I went again and I will continue to go again.,0
I ate the big patso with sausage and cheddar; the potatoes are absolutely incomparable with the frozen flavorless potatoes of many places today. It is a perfect form of sausage bread; potatoes and cheddar blended with sauce; and it is satisfying.,0
We ate the classic patso burger. In other words; french fries between fresh sandwich bread; ketchup mayonnaise on top. It tasted very good. No seating; we went to the park right next door and ate there.,0
Prices are not real; we thought it was a camera joke.,0
"It was very crowded, We wait while we're hungry!",0
Crispy on the outside; soft on the inside. It's always hot; it's a little crowded; there's no place to sit.,0
I tried the large patso with sausage and cheddar. It was delicious and fresh. You can try.,0
160-year-old Vefa Bozacisi has not lost its flavor. We can find filled bottles in many places; but it's different to come here and drink. It's definitely fresher to drink on the spot.Vefa BozacÄ±sÄ±,0
It was very nice to taste the boza in the historical place. Way better than other bozas.,0
A historical place intertwined with history. The business is clean and tidy. The staff is very caring.,0
Boza's are beautiful. The ones on sale are also freshly filled and prepared. It looks clean; but I don't know the exact details.,0
Same taste for years. Its historical texture is another beautiful place.,0
The taste is very good; and you can buy some roasted chickpeas; and it will be very high. Employees should be smiling.,0
The number of tables is very small; but no problem; the taste was very good.,0
I don't understand what kind of business it is to sell boza in a foam glass. Offering chickpeas is a tradition next to the spoiler; but in Vefa you have to go and buy it yourself from the shop on the opposite side.,0
Vefa Bozacisi must be the most beautiful place that comes to mind when Boza is mentioned. The groceries are quite affordable.,0
It is a flavor that can be tried when you go to Istanbul.,0
It is not p/p. Doner came cold and that's why it was hard.,0
Eating with this view... It was legendary!,0
There is a place to eat fish and bread across the beautiful place. If the weather is nice; we go to this doner shop; if not there. You can try.,0
They deserve the stars more than enough for their service; hygiene and view; but if we talk about the food; I can say that it was the most delicious in a one-week Istanbul trip without exaggeration.,0
Different from the price on the menu Price has been applied doner is dry and hard.,0
A taste that hasn't changed for years with its legendary view and taste!,0
You can go even for the view... The interest is very beautiful.. Those who want to eat meat (Halal food) should definitely stop by..,0
We finished Iskender and Doner Burger with difficulty two weeks ago; we couldn't start the dessert part because there was no appetite for tail fat.,0
Ambiance was amazing!,2
I think they make very good doner kebabs. We did not have any problems with the service. We parted happily as a family. As for the price; I think such a place has a very good tariff for such a view.,0
"When we asked for a hamburger, we were told that it was not left; but the hamburger came to the side table; I'm breaking two points from here; other than that it was good.",0
"Service, attention is excellent. The masters working in the kitchen love their job. Dining halls and sinks are very stylish; organized and hygienic.",0
The presentation was very successful; the employees were very interested and thoughtful and everything was delicious. We thank you.,0
Food service was also very fast. I ate a delicious Lokum meat. Then I ate an unbelievably good burger.,0
The most successful steak restaurant in the region. It is also a world brand. With its carefully selected meats and cooking technique; it gives the price you what you pay.,0
Prices are so high..,0
I do not recommend the lamb cage at all. But skewered and tenderloin are great. My carrot slice isn't bad. The waiters are interested and polite; but there are difficulties in understanding the order. You would like it cooked well; it comes undercooked.,0
We've been here many times and each time we left satisfied; Lokum meat; spaghetti; nusret hamburger; salad with tulum cheese; etc. very good but of course high in price compared to many places.,0
It's as if your old meticulousness is gone. The cage arrived cold; the salad came for 1; I said two; I did not drink alcohol; but 6 double raki was written in my account; when I told the waiter; he said are you sure you didn't drink?,0
There is a queue at the door; there are wonderful places in SarÄ±yer. I came with the force of my friends; the music chosen is similar to the music played in Italian pizzeria.,0
He's very successful. Even though it was very crowded; the service was incredibly fast.,0
By the lake; with a beautiful view; ducks are swimming next to you. 1 pan of squid; 1 portion of sea bass; 1 salad; 2 50 sized tuborgs; 2 tea 80 TL.,0
The presentations are very good; it obviously has a skilled and attentive chef. Fish and squid are fresh.,0
DEFINITELY DO NOT COME. We came here for breakfast based on the reviews on the way. We said the breakfast called the village breakfast for 2 people. First of all; the employee greeted us disrespectfully; a thousand pieces falling off his face; reluctant movements etc. It didn't taste good either!,0
Right next to the KÃ¶yceÄŸiz lake; the prices are a click above the average; a good business with a panoramic view of the lake.,0
Koycegiz is the most popular restaurant and cafe. You can have a meal with the view of KÃ¶yceÄŸiz lake and sip your cold beer with pleasure.,0
A place we stopped by for breakfast on the way. The place has a beautiful view of KÃ¶yceÄŸiz lake. The owner is very sweet and helped us with everything.,0
It was rainiy but the ambiance was good enough.,0
They bring delicious yoghurt to the dishes; the portions are hearty; with a beautiful view of the lakeside.,0
I recommend the handmade hamburger at a good price; reasonable (50TL) and satisfying. Sprinkled village breakfast (125 TL per person) is a weak; ordinary breakfast.,0
Tantuni was amazing. We just came here to try it.,0
In general; it is delicious; you can ask for both wrap and bread. Although the waiting time is around 10 minutes; the red cabbage and pickled peppers served from the front satisfy you.,0
It is a cheap and delicious place for students.,0
Tantuni was amazing. Thank you Cici Tantuni!,0
The pickles that came after you placed your order were very nice. Tantuni is not bad; you can try it. But I would say it's a little oily.,0
Great tantuni; thanks!,2
The ambiance of the place was a bit dark.,0
I tried tantuni with yoghurt for the first time. The taste was perfect. I would recommend it to everyone. It reminds me of the taste of iskender.,0
Prices are like that.,0
It was very oily; but good in taste. Prices are a little higher than usual.,0
If you want a different taste in KaÅŸ; they serve it by putting meat; chicken or meatballs cooked for a long time on the bun bread; you can order the drink separately with fried potatoes.,0
A fast food restaurant with very friendly staff. It didn't appeal to my taste at all. Undercooked dough and lint meat.,0
Overall it wasn't bad. It was delicious and ice cold. Mohair meat was delicious. The fries were nice. However; the bread that gives the place its name is a disappointment.,0
It has a hearty menu that starts with a very sweet encounter; it was quite delicious; the pepper sauce they made is successful.,0
There are many options on the menu and the average portion price is 50 TL. One portion is very satisfying; but if you don't like dough; you've come to the wrong address. They put the ingredients of your choice between a soft steamed bread.,0
I really liked the handmade basil buttermilk and lemonade. The chicken sandwich is okay; I think the chocolate one has nothing to say; it only had strawberries in it; there could be more fruit like waffles.,0
I can say that cleanliness; taste; warm-blooded employees were absolutely perfect.,0
We came to Bunbun for a snack at noon. We generally liked what we ate; including the vegan ones. We especially loved the one with beetroot. Meaty ones are nice. I really liked their fries.,0
They make hamburgers from bun bread and come with french fries. Quite tasty and satisfying.,0
If you come to KaÅŸ and do not eat bunbun here; you are not considered to have come to KaÅŸ. I would definitely recommend you to try it. Especially the ayran is wonderful.,0
We ordered meatballs and handmade meatballs that were baked for 6 hours. Meatballs were delicious; meat was delicious.,0
Even though it was overcrowded; our orders came very quickly. Except for the kÃ¼nefe; all the treats were delicious. The kÃ¼nefe tasted oily. I recommend you to go to a very clean and relevant place.,0
You get full like crazy in the range of 150-200 per person. It's beautiful inside. Easy to access.,0
Orders that came really shockingly fast and the treats were delicious.,0
The treats were excellent; but I did not like the main dish; it was not fully cooked; other than that; the treats and service were very good.,0
"I always go to this restourant, the treats are constantly renewed and the kebabs are good. There are sweet treats after the meal. The only problem is that it is usually very full and noisy.",0
The treats are constantly being refreshed.. all the waiters are very interested.. The taste was not overly good.,0
There was no delay in meals. As soon as the soup was finished; the meal arrived. The meals are quite delicious.,0
As soon as you sit down; treats come to your table. Abundant; varied and constantly renewed refreshments. It is a recommendation to everyone who got full marks from us...,0
Lots of quality extras and unlimited treats. After the meal; cigarettes are offered as a treat; which is very interesting.,0
This is the best aspava restaurant. The treats were perfect.,0
Appetizers and service came quickly. The glasses are badly scratched. Especially the fries were fresh and delicious. Raw meatballs and stuffed meatballs were like mud without flavor.,0
I recommend profiteroles and meringue; they are their own production. The entrance is suitable for the disabled. It's good that they're paying attention to this.,0
The best place to eat local food in MuÄŸla. Master Fikret's food is excellent. You should definitely stop by here.,0
I went with my friends; their milk desserts were very good.,0
The cheddar pastry was very bad compared to the past. It has reached the level of a normal patisserie; it used to be better.,0
We went to eat dessert as a family and we were satisfied. It was a bit crowded.,0
It's cold and extremely bad; the price of the food is way above its quality; 46 liras for 6 meatballs; 30 minutes or more waiting time. I definitely don't recommend it.,0
Very good quality and expensive also always crowded.,0
Everything you eat is very fresh and delicious. The back of the place is in the concept of a restaurant and the 2nd floor is in the concept of a cafe. We liked it very much.,0
I ate awesome pasta; I recommend to you..,0
It can be preferred for breakfast. The salt of the flakes was a little lacking; so it affects the taste; but it was not a problem.,0
"Bagel / crispy is tasteless; the outer crust is hard, and the tea is tasteless due to its water. Boiled egg craved but I gave up because it was peeled.",0
Prices are very affordable; boyoz is fresh and nice. Finding breakfast items such as olives; cheese and honey in addition to Boyoz also adds to the beauty.,0
The most beautiful boyoz is clear here! Those who claim otherwise should reconsider their taste. I have never eaten such good boyoz in my life.,0
I like it a lot. Prices are reasonable. Many varieties of boyoz available.,0
In terms of taste; minced meat and pastrami were very good. Tahini was medium. Olive was good too.,0
The boyoz with mozzarella was legendary; the salt taste coming from the back really makes the boyoz delicious.,0
It's a very cute oven. It opens early in the morning. Boyozes are very delicious; I loved the one with mozzarella.,0
I ate boyoz for the first time. For me; I guess I wouldn't eat it again. Frankly; it's not a taste that I will look for and miss.,0
I ate a variety of boyoz for the first time and I liked it very much. The service is fast and the atmosphere is friendly. If you come to Izmir; do not pass by here.,0
I came with recommendation and it really tasted good. It doesn't have a very different taste; so I don't think you will have a problem whether it fits your palate or not.,0
It was the best SushiCo restaurant I've experienced. Sushi was perfect and delicious.,0
First of all; our orders came very quickly. Edamame came without salt; which we liked a lot. You can add your own. We ordered tuna and salmon as sashimi. I couldn't eat good sashimi in Istanbul for a long time; unfortunately this place did not pass the exam.,0
Service was good; transportation was easy. Prices are above average. For those who don't like the taste of raw fish; I recommend roles instead of nigiri.,0
The food is fresh; delicious and the atmosphere is quality as always.,0
Pretty good sushi; attentive; friendly service..,0
The flavors were good in general; the prices were a bit high.,0
It didn't suit my taste but my wife loved it. The place was beautiful.,0
Started off well with nice duck sushi and prawn gyoza; but was given wrong meat in pad Thai so sent it back. No apologies. Ordered spring rolls; they never came.,0
Very clean restaurant... Tasty suchi and noodles.,0
We ordered sole fish; fried haddock; fried mussels; and sardines. Our favorite among them was sole fish. The only thing that bothered me was that the men's and women's toilets were a common and single toilet.,0
The taste really lives up to expectations. It is a business that maintains frying fish; which is essentially a fast food; in accordance with its craft. I liked.,0
Very cheap against portions.,0
Our back hurt while eating; the place was clean.,0
Fish and bread are delicious but the place has gone back every year. Cleanliness and hygiene are almost non-existent; employees are weary and reluctant.,0
I think they cook very fast and delicious fish; and they have very sweet employees; I definitely recommend them. I also strongly recommend the pickle juice and sole fish.,0
Prices are a little bit high.,0
We ate our meal on the top floor; the location of the place was beautiful. The flavors and portions were good. I suggest you to eat fish bread.,0
I went to there with my girl friend; I liked fishes but she did not like because fishes are a little bit oily.,0
Portions are huge.. sardines are delicious; fish is very oily; so you have to eat bread. Therefore; the best choice is between bread.,0
There are only Kumru and Kumpir options; the Kumru is not bad; it needs a little more oil; I can't say it's very tasty. The place is beautiful in terms of location; but there is a crowd; so the staff cannot keep up.,0
The material of the kumru is medium quality; the portion is small. We were 3 persons. All three of us had burnt bread.,0
Excellent. I recommend.,2
I ate the best dove I've ever eaten here. Everyone should come!!,0
"Crowded but no problem, flavor is okay.",0
"Kumpir is delicious. Super Kumru is really good. Compared to other places, we can say that the prices are reasonable and the service quality is high. quality materials used.",0
I'm really surprised; it's a huge business; but the staff is so indifferent and bored.,0
"Beautiful place; in a perfect location; clean and equipped with quality; these definitely deserve a star; but as someone who loves dove and has experienced it in every corner of Izmir (AlÃ§atÄ±; BostanlÄ±; Ä°nciraltÄ±; Ã‡eÅŸme; etc.), this ""dove"" is not the only thing that can be said.",0
Food came a little late but that was okay. Prices were as you can see in the photo. It wasn't a bad experience.,0
I can recommend it to those who want to eat a delicious dove in a beautiful place. Kumru's price is 45â‚º.,0
Definitely. Texts the dove's book. The Kumpir they ordered was also excellent.,0
Bread was a bit stale and no problem except taking the order late and waiting. Meatballs are delicious as always.,0
The order came fast. I loved the doner and chicken. It was well cooked. But orders came late.,0
The place was really dirty and the orders came late.,0
The fact that all the employees were women made me very happy; the tastes were good.,0
Their service was a little slow; the flavors were on point. I had breakfast; there was unlimited tea; it was a different situation that they brought the tea in a water glass.,0
Great service; attention and relevance It was nice. Everything was perfect.,0
Its meatballs are beautiful. So is soup and salad too.,0
The meat had a fabricated taste.,0
Kofteci Yusuf tastes the same everywhere. employees are constantly running towards somewhere; it is very difficult to catch and order.,0
We told the staff a very modest breakfast plate; there is unlimited tea; and the breakfast was really good. There was everything up to 4 kinds of cheese and it only cost 54 liras.,0
Nice atmosphere; pleasant place. The employees are young; smiling and fast. The breakfast is very nice. Souffles are A-MA-ZING!,0
They do sushi every thursday and I missed so it was a little sad to miss it. Other than that; the food was good.,0
Definitely the best soufflÃ© I've had in a long time. I am satisfied; I recommend.,0
Asian salmon pastas and salad varieties are very successful. They have not neglected to share the secret of their taste.,0
Souffle heaven has a wonderful variety of flavors; I highly recommend it.,0
The waiters were understanding; but the food came cold and late.,0
I tried Antep taco; I liked.,0
The prices are the same as the market; but the staff and service quality are better than others; their special tastes are definitely recommended.,0
Not very special Gaziantep dishes; but you can find a comfortable and serene atmosphere in Antep. One of the places that can be stylish for the evening.,0
Taco; on the other hand; was no different than a vegetable wrap wrapped in lavash. It was a decent experience.,0
The staff is very fast; the waffles are great; I definitely recommend it.,0
The waffle was very successful; especially the dough was very delicious. The ice cream they use with such a nice waffle is of very poor quality. The only negative thing is that the employees are constantly checking to see if the food is finished.,0
Although they are actually a place that makes waffles; their burgers are delicious and they have a lot of options.,0
It had very good service. It was also nice to have a lot of choices in waffles.,0
You can add the product you want to the waffle or hamburger with your own choice. You're kind of the chief.,0
Waffles were delicious and their tea was fresh. It wasn't insane for the price. I'm thinking of coming again.,0
Everything was very good; the waffles were very tasty; the employees were very concerned and smiling. It is recommended.,0
It's a great place with everything; it's a very good place whether it's about food or interest; it's a very nice place for waffles.,0
I can say that it is the only cafe in Samsun where you can eat waffle dessert properly. You can go without thinking.,0
"Good waffles, we liked it.",0
I ate better waffle's in past.,0
It was the most delicious adana kebab I ate in Alanya. The prices were also normal. The only thing missing was the salad.,0
Renovated is pretty good. There is nothing to say about the food and the soups. Especially the lahmacun was perfect.,0
don't accidentally break a glass or plate; they add 20 lira to your account unannounced.,0
Location of the restourant was good; easy to access.,0
Everything is very good; thank you for your efforts; the meats and dishes in the newly added a la carte menus are legendary; I definitely recommend it.,0
Good place to eat. However; the staff work poorly: They can easily forget to bring some dishes or add seasonings; even though they previously admitted to the contrary.,0
Not the best; but not bad.,0
Quite unpolite service; but the meal was good. The salad with the vinegar was extremely good.,0
Everything was great; definitely coming back when I'm in Alanya again.,0
We came here with my family. Staff was very friendly; responsive and professional. Our order was delivered very quickly. The restaurant serve Turkish cuisine. One of the best in Alanya. Recommended.,0
I drank Beyran soup; the taste of the soup was not bad. The lahmacun was good.,0
Beyran is really delicious; the service is fast. Friendly and warm waiters.,0
We came to drink beyran soup for breakfast. We really liked the taste. The accompanying breads were delicious.,0
I had eaten Beyran in a few places; but I didn't like it very much. I drank here and liked it. I can drink it every day.,0
We went for Beyran but it didn't in menu today. We had to order lahmacun and kebab. The lahmacun is awful; the adana kebab and lamb shish kebab are delicious.,0
I ate katmer here for the first time and I couldn't forget its taste and smell. It may be the most beautiful dessert in the world!!,0
We ate Beyran. We preferred less spicy; the price is 60 TL. The place is clean; the service is fast.,0
Lahmacun was terrible.,2
We tried Lahmacun and Beyran. They were beautiful; thank you.,0
I'm ending my vacation by leaving my favorite food here..,0
We had the opportunity to taste beyran for the first time in our lives and we had heard of the reputation of Metanet's beyran. At first; we had a bit of a prejudice; to be honest; about the intense aroma of meat or fat; but it's not like that at all. Beyrani is so delicious and balanced that we can eat it at any time of the day; morning; noon and evening.,0
A very nice place; five stars as the location. If it is the flavor you are looking for; you may not find the exact flavor that you want.,0
Everything is fine; but I have to deduct 1 point because of the prices. There is no problem in taste; presentation and cleanliness.,0
They used to taste better; the chef must have changed.,0
In terms of price performance; I think it is quite reasonable. Employees were also very kind; thank you. I was very satisfied with the spicy-sweet sauce chicken I ate. Only the fries on the side were too simple in my opinion.,0
Breakfast in the morning is usually very crowded on weekends. Service may be delayed. Meals wasn't bad.,0
Compared to other places; it was more airy and calm by the sea. Thanks.,0
Great ambiance; delicious dishes..,0
Due to the crowd; my order came late; there is no problem other than that.,0
The food is delicious; the view is beautiful.,0
I went on the recommendation of my friend. Everything at breakfast was delicious. Only the butter had a peculiar smell.,0
The strawberry cake was great; there was fresh dough. And we only paid for what we ate; drank; portioning; etc. no extra fees were asked. It's a wonderful place,0
When there are so many employees; orders are forgotten; tables are not looked at. The food is really delicious.,0
I definitely come here every time I come; I like both breakfast and evening meals; but prices have increased a lot from last year to this year.,0
The worst service I have seen; no one knows what they are doing ,0
If you want a delicious and local breakfast on the beach; you should definitely try it.Kuymak is even closed to discussion.,0
there are 10 waiters standing; the tables are empty; but the service is very slow. What we ate was delicious.,0
My first stop for breakfast in Atakum is a place with quality service and friendly face.,0
It's nice to have a children's playground. There are a lot of staff working. Good as place and location.,0
The tastes; the approach of the stuff to you and the quality of service are very good; of course; especially if you can find a place on the weekend.,0
Teas we could only drink 1 tea for a cold breakfast; the staff is being artistic to the customer; fighting and walking on top of him; there is an uncomfortable environment.,0
This place is beautifully decorated; has excellent staff; successful flavors; plenty of variety.,0
The service is absolutely amazing; the working friends are very kind; there is no need to explain the taste; it is a restaurant that should definitely be visited.,0
Portions were very filling and good. We had a nice Sunday breakfast.,0
The view is nice; the indoor seating area is quite large.,0
It is a place to eat good pastries in Sariyer. I recommend you to try the mince raisin. Tea 5 TL 1 portion of Meat Pie with Raisins 30 TL,0
Pastries varieties and pogaca are delicious. There are also breakfast options available. The staff is caring and helpful. Service is fast. I think the prices are reasonable.,0
Good with potatoes; good with cheese; medium with spinach; medium with minced meat. Plain pastry was good; pastry was good. I did not like the tea.,0
The prices were too high for a place that sells pastries or pastries.,0
I'm a regular at currants and pastries with minced meat. It is both delicious and definitely does not disturb the stomach after eating.,0
Service sucks. Customer care is below zero. The view is very good but the place is extremely neglected.,0
It gets very crowded because it's the weekend; we have to go a little early; you may not find a place to eat something,0
It's too plentiful; so I guess the prices are high. But a mixture of so many different dishes was not that good.,0
The most delicious rice I have ever eaten. The ambiance of the environment is terrific; its desserts were amazing too.,0
I ate baruthane kebab with rice; it was very good; a little expensive.,0
The place is beautiful and clean. The employees were very kind and concerned. I ate rice and also had sautÃ©ed chicken. The flavor was good except the chicken sautÃ© was greasy.,0
Prices was high.,2
It was nice experience; you have to try it.,0
250 TL account was received for 1 portion of rice + kuru fasulye + ayran + Cola. Service and waiters are very bad.,0
It's not something to be exaggerated; and people come from out of town just for their rice. The waiters were kind; the environment was clean.,0
The flavor is excellent. Roasting meat was like cotton. Price is a little above normal. Location of the restourant was really good.,0
There was only 3-4 chickpeas in my rice; it was a bit unsalted. Treats were good. It had a classic rice flavor.,0
The menu is very nice; the food is legendary; also the waiters were very polite.,0
I had high expectations but the kebabs were unsuccessful. Hummus was good. They use quality olive oil.,0
There was a hair strand in my food! There is no problem in service or interest other than this issue; they give the right to the fee they receive.,0
"They have very delicious meat; especially tiny lahmacun, super appetizers; delicious food here. The food is very nice. The workers can be a little more interested. They are very interested in Arab customers. They don't care about us. This situation makes us sad.",0
Nice place but the order came very late; the prices are not so high. It can be tried.,0
"very clean table arrangement is good; waiters are very interested; they look immediately; the order comes without a long wait, the food is really delicious as it is said; it is excellent; I recommend it.",0
We came with a guest from abroad; everything was perfect. Taste; cleanliness; service..,0
It is a luxurious place where you can try the delicious tastes of both Turkish and Arabic cuisine.,0
Please review the ticket slip. A business that wants money for the bread on the table; 20 TL for the service fee; 20 TL for the valet.,0
Unfortunately; the waiters are very uninterested. Since there are too many Arab customers; the attention and interest is more towards them. Stones were found in my food?!,0
Even though the service is terrible; they ask for a service fee of 144 TL; what a nonsense!,0
Hatay gastronomy house is an excellent place; you should definitely go... Quality and affordable...,0
Ambient food; nice open area; heated pet friendly place; renovated garden is very nice.,0
The venue is beautiful. Food/desserts taste good. I loved the Popcorn Shrimp from the hot appetizers. I loved Pose Armut. Overall good price/performance.,0
We went for both breakfast and dinner. First of all; it has a very nice environment. When we went for breakfast; we sat inside and one can sit for hours. Its decoration; quiet and nice; being in the trees is very nice. Especially having an open kitchen adds a positive score to the customer.,0
The place is very beautiful; the food is so delicious; you can go with your pet to one of the rare restaurants that cook the meat to the exact consistency you want. The toilets are not separate for men's and women's toilets so there was a bit of a cleaning problem.,0
The service is slow; I think there is a lack of staff and unhappiness; it has not to expensive and it was seedy experience.,0
Although it was crowded; the ambiance and food of the place was nice. Thank you.,0
Great place.. Contrary to the comments; the employees were interested.. The hot dog was impressive.. The hamburger was not bad.,0
Despite the current times; it was a very pleasant visit. They currently donâ€™t take booking; they have a walk-in system where you put your name down and after a short wait they seat you inside. Once inside you can opt to be put on a waitlist to sit outside. The setting is really nice and rustic and the tables are well distanced. There was a nice evening crowd and a good energy in the ambience.,0
The service provided was very nice; I was happy.,0
Smoked salmon salad was average. Colored eggs do not contribute to the taste. Salmon was too salty; fried potatoes were bland.,0
Eggs Benedict with pork bacon was nice.,0
Excellent taste; and the shabbyness of the place was also nice.,0
A full student meal. The price is cheap and the taste is high.,0
It's a place with very affordable and delicious pasta. Actually; there is not much variety of pasta. Classic pasta is served with cheddar cheese and sauce. I think the taste and price of the pasta is very good.,0
They serve an uncooked pasta with a tasteless sauce and cheese and some corn. Half portion is 20 TL. It didn't suit my taste.,0
I think it was pretty cool. The price of a portion of pasta was 22 TL. I highly recommend you go.,0
classic alavara pasta; if you don't have a tiny little stomach; say it right. Pasta 42 TL price performance product...,0
The taste is unbelievably good and satisfying enough; it is also very affordable; but you have a hard time finding an incredibly crowded place.,0
Not to mention pasta; their sauces are so successful that you can destroy the whole plate without noticing. Also; the dumplings are nice.,0
It was the most delicious pasta I have ever eaten; thank you.,0
Service was fast. I ate ravioli; it was good.,0
Surprised location; but nice clean venue. The employees are friendly; I don't want to comment on the prices; they were too high..,0
In general; I was satisfied; since the hamburger is a little small; it will be more satisfying if the one with a higher grammage is chosen.,0
Burgers are great hot dogs do. It is very interesting that french fries are 114 TL.,0
Hamburger is really delicious. The fries are normal.,0
The best hamburger restaurant in Istanbul. Cooking and sauce is very good.,0
Burgers are super. I've eaten hamburgers in many places; but I've never come across anything like this. Fantastic meal with friendly service in a small but cozy place. I strongly recommend.,0
The delicious combination of truffle sauce and burger was legendary.,0
It was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. The only downside is that the portion is a little small. Apart from that; it is definitely a place to experience.,0
Well prepared hamburger; special taste. But a little bit expensive.here/,0
It is delicious in everything with its sauce and bread.,0
The taste is good; but it's not worth paying 90 TL for a wet hamburger-sized burger and not even getting fries...,0
They make the pizza in a wood fired stone oven. It's different than any pizza you've experienced before. They use cheddar cheese as cheese. We preferred the 2 and 3 special pizzas.,0
I definitely recommend the seasonal kenger pizza. We also loved the sauce in three different olive oils; one with garlic; thyme and hot pepper.,0
You can't get enough of the thin pizza dough. Overcrowded employees are very concerned. We ate pizza at Mia highly recommend.,0
Staff were quick but surly. the service was actually fast; i can't afford it. We ordered chicken and mushroom pizza; its taste was normal; the dough was very thin and it wasn't burnt; which was the only good thing. Coming to the wage issue; there were prices that did not match the prices of luxury restaurants.,0
I think it's a nice place. Pizza was also nice; but a little expensive. I liked their sauce.,0
First of all; the atmosphere is nice; but there should be a solution for flies in the open air; such as fans that blow water. As for the pizza; although the view is beautiful; neither my wife and I did not like the pizza; unfortunately; the sauces that came only to pour on the pizza were good.,0
You should definitely go once and eat pizza. But I don't know if it happened to us; but the faces of the employees were never smiling and they were not caring.,0
We did pizza experience after a long road. As a place; it is very nice; pizzas are delicious; but we can say that the prices are a bit expensive.,0
Amazing pizzas omg!,2
The place is spacious; clean. Pizza dough is thin. You had the chance to try 6 types of pizza; I can say that the best is the model with spinach and smoked turkey.,0
"The dough is very crispy and the most successful part is definitely the dough. And the dough was waiting overnight. Also, there is a 2-3 hour queue; so crowded.",0
The flavors are number 10. A little expensive; it may be too much for people with a medium budget.,0
I ate kÃ¼ÅŸleme; simit kebab; mixed cubes. The frosting was juicy and pretty good.,0
Meats are tasty without fat; but not very suitable for me. Since I like the meat cooked more; I couldn't enjoy it much anyway; I couldn't finish what I ordered. Although the portions are small; the prices are quite expensive.,0
I think the place is overrated. We said mixed in the middle; it was a disgusting image. Simit kebab was good. But the prices were too high.,0
Delicious but not overdone.,0
Deserts was amazing; especially baklava! Liked it.,0
Its kÃ¼ÅŸleme was great. It was very well cooked and juicy. However; the portion was small and they warn about this before ordering. Still; its meat is so delicious that it is worth eating. Prices are a little expensive.,0
4 people mixed menu with their own salad; 750 TL. For those who say price is not a problem. Meat tastes excellent. There is a parking lot.,0
We ate kÃ¼ÅŸleme; it was amazing. But as you can see; really really expensive.,0
We came from out of the town to try their meat. We waited in line for a while; but that's okay. It was an amazing experience. I recommend it to everyone.,0
It was too oily and the place had problems with cleanliness.,0
It was too spicy on my first try; but after a few bites I got used to it. The taste is really good; I like it.,0
it tasted so good that I even ordered and ate the second one!,0
The taste is good but not satisfying.,0
We came to Abidin Tantuni with my friends from out of town. The pickles and of course the tantuni were very nice.,0
Tantuni is delicious; service is fast; service is quality. Price of one portion is 85TL,0
Great job; thank you!,0
we had a delicious tantuni experience. I was amazed by the taste of ayran; pickles and tantuni trio.,0
One of the Most Beautiful Meat Tantuni Places. Meat tantuni is very tasty. It's a roadside place. It's a regular restaurant.,0
The smell is awesome; the taste is normal; the speed is very good. We are full; thank you very much. Ayran was also nice.,0
We wanted to try this place as it is famous. We paid more than 800 liras for 2 people; 1.5 portions of Iskender and a drink.,0
Iskender kebab is not a meal worth that much money when I look at the price of 195 TL for 1 portion; rather than its taste.,0
Iskender is very delicious; you can optionally pour butter; what is interesting to me is that there are no treats.,0
The first time I ate; it's really worth the price. Taste and hygiene are the most important for me. Toilets were clean.,0
My order came cold.,0
There is no problem of waiting queue; the ambiance of the place is nice; well done.,0
It is very delicious; even the yogurt. However; a very very expensive portion of Iskender should not be 225 lirasâ€¦,0
Iskender kebab is a nice; clean and well-served place in Bursa.,0
The interior is very well designed. It has a historical texture. Employees were engaged. Frankly; the taste of iskender was not overly good; it was normal.,0
Expensive; poor presentation; taste was not good enough to come from out of town and try. There are no treats.,0
The staff is very polite and very concerned. Thank you for the delicious food.,0
We ate oil ravioli and special ravioli. The ravioli was weak compared to the price. Employees are smiling.,0
We wanted to try it for yaglama; it was disappointing for me; it had little ground meat; it didn't taste good; the appetizers were bad.,0
Not perfect but good.,0
We ate special ravioli; classic ravioli; yaglama; they were not friendly; their yaglama was like minced meat pasta; not greasing.,0
A very pleasant and quiet restaurant. Most importantly; the food is great. Everything I tasted was delicious.,0
The ravioli tasted good and was satisfying as a portion; the portion was very small compared to the price of the yaglama.,0
The restaurant is very nice and elegant. We were greeted very kindly; the flavors were good.,0
Legendary flavors; I was amazed!,0
I tried Kayseri's traditional ravioli and special ravioli. The special was just right for my taste. I like. We also tried yaglama but it wasn't as good as I imagined. It was also cold.,0
After waiting for about 20 minutes; we were able to eat Classic AyvalÄ±k Toast. It was delicious and crunchy.,0
Small busy place. We didn't wait long; service was fast. The toast was delicious but the portion was small and expensive.,0
First of all; they don't accept credit cards. The place is small; you can wait in line to sit. It's worth the taste.,0
I loved it; with one word it was legendary. In other words; it is the best toast you can eat outside. The price is 35 TL for full Ayvalik toast; Ayran Lemonade is 15 TL.,0
Bread; cheese; sausage all left incredible flavors on our palate. We recommend it to everyone who will go to AyvalÄ±k.,0
We paid 150 TL for 2 toast and 2 ayran. The only address of AyvalÄ±k Toast. There are many queues; but the queue moves very quickly. Worth the wait.,0
Ambiance could be better.,0
The place had problems with cleanliness. Prices were a little expensive.,0
When you go to AyvalÄ±k; I definitely recommend you to go here to eat toast. Perfect taste.,0
Crispy and delicious toast.,0
Excellent Roman pizza. Fast; pleasant and courteous service.,0
What an awesome place. The fried starters were lush; as were the rice balls. However; the pizza was amazing; the best I have tasted (in Rome).,0
It was quite crowded so we waited in line for a long time. The flavor was good.,0
Authentic Italian restaurant; best pizza I ever ate in my life. You know itâ€™s going to be good when Italians go there. Prices are really cheap as well; it was only 8â‚¬ for my pizza.,0
I strongly recommend. The best of the best. Very thin and soft. Nice service and reasonable price.,0
The pizzeria in the heart of Testaccio is open from 19:00 without reservation... fills up immediately. Excellent typical Roman pizza.,0
Great thin crust pizza. Its super busy so be prepared for a decent wait. The suppli and fiore di zucca aren't the best; but the pizzas are top notch.,0
It was much better on our last visit (6 years ago). This time we were not satisfied with the service or the quality of the pizza.,0
"Not touristic, that's why super. The place is real; truly local; authentic. Atmosphere here is really special. Waiters are cool guys; not trying to be super polite. Love it!",0
Awesome locals spot for pizza and typical Roman fare.,0
Best pizza around. GOAT status. Have to try that Diavola pizza. Absolutely no cap!,0
The food is quite delicious. The prices are higher than the average in Samsun; but suitable for a decent place. The waiters were interested; the appetizers were delicious.,0
DiyarbakÄ±r Ocakbasi is one of the most established places of Samsun; but I couldn't understand this branch. The taste of the food is very good; there is no problem about it; but the service is very heavy; the number of staff is insufficient.,0
The view is beautiful; the food is good. It's about the waiters. If you are going alone in the evening; a reservation seems to be a must. Too crowded.,0
It was a great place; the most beautiful meatloaf I've ever eaten in my life.  The cheddar lahmacun and stuffed ribs were perfect; and the meat had no smell. The service is nice; they respect.,0
When we last arrived; many of the products on the menu were not available. It is also interesting that there are no liver skewers in the place called Ocakbasi.,0
2 appetizers 1 salad the smell of blood and the taste of meat were disgusting chicken and lamb were fine.,0
I gave unnecessary money. It had no taste; no service. It was very expensive.,0
A restaurant that has lost its previous refinement. Lahmacun as seen in the photo. The service is slow. I recommend a little more wannabe and attention.,0
The food was great; the service was fast and the staff was friendly. Stuffed ribs were very fresh and delicious.,0
We tried Lahmacun and Beyti. They both taste great.,0
Their meat was incredibly bad. Chicken canada had another taste.  The service is nice; but I would say the flavor is 0. In a cooker; this tastelessness is surprising; obviously.,0
It's nice that it's open every time in a day. Turkish coffee + tea + 2 pastries =52TL. Service is average... Turkish coffee is not tasty.,0
Delicious tastes; clean place.,0
We have a full breakfast and pay 20 TL. Isn't it perfect?,0
We had a pleasant breakfast in a bright environment.,0
There's a mess inside; the business really needs to improve on the organization.,0
A bakery and Patisserie that offers quality; delicious and plenty of options.,0
Great cafe. Excellent staff. Brilliant cakes and pastries.,0
Thanks for great breakfast experience!,0
It seems like the products were better last year.. There is always a queue.,0
The donut had no filling in it so it was like sweet bread.,0
Prices were cheap. But the queue was too long. I liked the flavors as a korean.,0
A delicious udon that you can enjoy even in the middle of summer! It was very hot; cramped and crowded with people and I had two bowls of udon and a side dish with two bottles of booze.,0
The set composition was good! Chicken egg rice and karaage were delicious. Many Koreans come here for udon. Waiters are friendly and service is fast!,0
Lovely and delicious..,2
5-10 min walk from the Louvre (depending on which side you come from). I ate really delicious things. I would definitely recommend.,0
The best udon restaurant in the capital! Few tables however; making a lot of waiting at peak times.,0
The queue was not that long fortunately! The staffs were all very kind and welcoming. The food was amazing! The udon was the hero; it was very flavorful & juicy!,0
There were few tables and chairs inside.,0
Best udon in Paris. Well Korean celebrities visits it too. Just a little bit crowded.,0
"As an udon restaurant close to the Louvre; it tastes just as good. There's quite a line at lunch, but your turn comes quickly.",0
The tempura here is amazing.,0
Fast food restourant with a nice view. Staff are also friendly; mostly frequented by tourists.,0
Very very bad food and very bad service 0/10.,0
A very small hamburger. I can say that there are places where you can eat bigger and delicious hamburger menus for cheaper. The place is very busy and small. Finding a place to sit is a miracle.,0
I love fried chicken; I love KFC.,0
The menu I ordered was served hot; I ate it with my mouth and it was really perfect. But the place is very small and full to the brim. There is no place to sit.,0
It was delicious!,2
The chickens are very nice and tasty; I will not say the same for the hamburger.,0
Not friendly; zero customer service. Pretty disappointing. Limited ketchup sauce only two per customer..,0
They applied extra price because we were tourists; they tried to defraud us officially.,0
"The place is very nice; I think, the food was fresh and good; one of my favorite places.",0
I ate a lot of croissants; but this was the best quality beautiful croissant I've ever eaten in my life. Crispy on the outside; with lots of butter on the inside; the smell was amazing.,0
The place was crowded when we first went. We preferred chocolate croissants. It was fresh and beautiful.,0
Three of us went and had Avocado & Poached Eggs; Sausage Scrambled Eggs; Mushroom Scrambled Egg Croissant. I didn't like the avocado croissant because I don't like avocados.,0
It's a very enjoyable place. The croissants are amazing! The butter feels very good in mouth; it is crunchy. Salty and sweet; they're all great.,0
Wonderful. The amount of butter used in the croissant was so good that it never lost its taste and crunch. The coffee was fresh and of good quality.,0
Cheesecakes are a price / performance product; if they have it; you have to try it immediately. The teas were also very good.,0
It was too busy for a Monday. We waited 45 minutes.,0
The waiters were indifferent; I was not satisfied.,0
The croissants were delicious but tasted a bit bitter due to overcooking. The croissant with adjika was excellent. But we waited a long time,0
You wait in line for 20-50 minutes when you leave. Eating the poached egg croissant left a strange feeling in the mouth. Egg with mushrooms was unsalted.,0
Each mussel costs 7 liras. The place is big can sit inside and outside. There is a Bosphorus view in the place.,0
The kokorec and sauced mussels of this branch next to the sea are quite good.,0
"In a word, super. No need for expensive places. Very tasty; very clean. You can sit at the tables overlooking the Bosphorus and have a pleasant and reasonably priced meal. The staff is very caring.",0
Not too good; not too bad either.,0
10 mussels + half a kokorec is 240TL. Also; the place smells like toilet.,0
I had the chance to try classic mussels and mussels with sauce. Both were beautiful. Kokorec was also good.,0
Prices are a little bit high but tastes are nice.,0
In a word; it is magnificent; this is the heart of mussels in Istanbul. Atom kokoreÃ§ must be tasted. The mussels with sauce are another good one..,0
Taste has deteriorated compared to the past. I guess it's because he's famous. I do not recommend; you can eat betters in other restourants.,0
Magnificent view and legendary taste; and kokorec is also very good; I recommend it to everyone.,0
"If you go to Trabzon, it is a place you should definitely visit. I knew it was a historical rice cooker; and it tasted great.",0
Rice and roast are delicious! The inside can be visited like a museum; the employees are friendly. It's a bit pricey though; bring cash with you.,0
The rice was very oily but the roast was delicious. We paid 450â‚º for 3 people. Prices are a little high.,0
Dishes were really expensive.,0
It's just perfect; there is nothing to say.,0
A very authentic place; its roasted meat and bean on the rice is legendaryâ€¦ 1 portion is enough.. The taste of the compote they serve is indispensableâ€¦,0
2 roasted meat on rice + a ayran and a compote; a total of :220 It was nice that it was better roasted than rice.,0
I tried it after the positive reviews. Its rice and compote are nice. However; there are places in the Black Sea where I ate better roast beef. It's not a place I can say you should try. Prices are reasonable. The place is nice; the service was good.,0
I have never eaten such delicious roasted rice anywhere. Service presentation and environment was very very nice.,0
My order arrived late and cold. Prices were high.,0
An incredibly beautiful atmosphere with its historical texture and story. We preferred Roasted Meat on the Rice; it was delicious. Portions are very filling.,0
This is a place we always go for peri peri burger and crispy ravioli. Thanks for the treats.,0
We ordered the Cream Croissant. The chocolate was bitter and too liquid; I think it would be better if Nutella was applied. It was not a dessert worth the price. (145â‚º). They also forgot the tea I ordered.,0
It is much better decorated and the quality has been improved considerably. When you enter; a very pleasant cafe atmosphere and ambiance welcomes you. I recommend sitting close to the wood stove. We ordered breakfast and were satisfied. Toilets were very; very dirty.,0
I drank Turkish coffee; it was good.,0
The products were delicious; the atmosphere was nice. Prices are reasonable; service needs improvement.,0
Great viewed restourant.,2
They are not good in hygiene; portions are big; taste is good; prices are above average.. View is good.,0
Slow service; average taste.,0
In short; the plates brought to you are no different from the ones on the menu. Pizza is definitely in the top three I've ever eaten.,0
It's a nice cafe. A little curly haired busboy there was very kind to us. The service was nice.,0
We came across the Pavlova dish; it was delicious. Their fruit pasta wasn't bad either; but the kids really liked it. The staff is very caring and helpful.,0
Izmir bomb was nice. The ice cream tasted like milk (not goat's milk) that I was not used to; but it didn't bother me.,0
I am attaching the photos I could take about the menu and its prices. Overall it wasn't bad.,0
Although it is a classic; its products are ordinary. Prices are expensive for the quality.,0
Lemonade and desserts were terrific.,0
Everything we ordered was excellent especially the Pavlova cake.,0
I tried Pavlova but it was not what I expected. But it could also be about my choice.,0
We tried Tripple Berry Cheesecake and Pistachio Ice Cream; Strawberry Ice Cream. It was a complete disappointment for us. Especially the pistachio ice cream was highly praised; we couldn't understand why he was bragging.,0
Menu was like that. Average business.,0
Prices too high Turkish coffee 42.5TL Salty cookies weak.,0
Spacious; clean and comfortable place. Employees concerned. We didn't wait long for the order. It was one of the best lahmacun I've ever eaten. Prices are affordable.,0
It is a place that can be preferred for taste; but the appetizer variety is very weak. The toilets smelled.,0
The food is very delicious. I congratulate the value and sincerity of the employees in their work.,0
The space is comfortable and spacious. The service is fast; the staff is concerned. There are many types of kebab. We ordered shish shish and Adana; the taste is satisfactory. Prices were like market average.,0
Taste; hygiene; speed;service were all very good. I went for a late dinner; everything was very good.,0
We came from out of town. Kebab and skewers were great; and the strained yogurt appetizer was delicious; we will definitely come to you next visit.,0
The staff is very interested and fast; the environment is very nice; the food and appetizers are very tasty.,0
I liked the kebab and salad; but I can't say the same for their appetizers. It was less in variety; unfortunately; it was unpleasant for those who came. The ambiance was great.,0
It's delicious and the prices are reasonable. The appetizers are very filling and satisfying.,0
We were satisfied with the food; but the toilets are very dirty; I am deducting points from this issue.,0
Three Portions of Adana Kebab on one skewer and 3 drinks for 106 TL. My expectation was higher in terms of taste; but I cannot say that I could fully find this expectation. But the side dishes were not bad.,0
Highly recommend for a different and delicious experience. Being on the beach is very good as a place. Toilets are clean. No bad odor or irritating.,0
Everything really appeals to both the eyes and the stomach. They have an incredibly beautiful and varied menu. Prices are reasonable according to the taste; quality and satiety of the menu.,0
Every meal is a source of happiness at Magro. This time we tried chicken with almond sauce and Mac and cheese bolognese; it was delicious. Portions are very filling and very reasonable for the price.,0
Magro is a really nice place in terms of design. I ate chicken broth soup; tomato soup; magro burger and grilled sea bass. Presentation; portion and taste are good. However; it is very expensive.Service sucks.,0
Unique in Alsancak Kordon.. Good food; especially chicken wrap is awesome.,0
It is a classical home breakfast; so it is expensive for home breakfast.,0
Bad breakfast experince for me.,0
Everything I ate that in a super menu; was very good. I recommend this place to everyone.,0
Great service; great food; everything is great!,0
Nice and beautiful place. The breakfast spread was hearty and good. Prices are normal.,0
Margarita pizza is pretty good. The atmosphere is also nice. Toilets are very clean.,0
We came here for the first time; we just tried the doner; it was good; the treats were not bad; the staff was very interested.,0
Lahmacun tasted good and was filling. Some of the ingredients used in the salad started to deteriorate.,0
They've updated the prices and it's as if they have reduced the portions. It is irritating that the edges of the plates are broken.,0
I didn't like Iskender; the meat was not of good quality.,0
Even though it's not as good as it used to be; it's still my choice. I would be more satisfied if they boiled the stuffed meatballs.,0
Good in general. Quality for KÄ±zÄ±lay and its surroundings. Lahmacun doesn't taste old...,0
I go here for the lahmacun; I haven't tried their other dishes; but the lahmacun is very good.,0
I eat it by putting adana kebab in between the lahmacun. Legend is delicious; try it!,0
Service is good. Lahmacun was delicious.,0
Turkish meat doner was good; liked.,0
"Service, respect, taste literally 10/10.",0
Definitely a good tripe soup; but I've had much better ones. Very clean place; prices are a bit expensive.,0
In terms of taste; I can't say it's too good because we drink much better ones. As a business performance; even bread is sold for money alongside soup.,0
Portion is enough; taste is average; but unfortunately there is no hygiene. We sat in the garden but there was a heavy smell in the environment.,0
I found the trotter soup I was looking for; it was very nice; thank you. Employees are not friendly.,0
The trotter soup I drank here is among the top 3 soups I've had in my life. The food of the place is very delicious; the service is impeccable.,0
The taste is excellent; the portion size is good; the price is a bit expensive.,0
The business demands money from everything; no treats!,0
Ankara's oldest and most beautiful soup restourant. Soups with very good hygiene can be eaten and drunk with peace of mind. Service is fast. Prices are a little high.,0
Clean and decent place. I think it would be better if the soup was hot and fresh if there were bread facilities that came with it.,0
The environment is clean and nice. The taste of the food was not bad either.,0
I tried almost all of the dishes and they are very delicious; but the mushroom saute was a little oily; other than that; everything was delicious and good.. the staff were friendly and very kind.,0
The service is good; the employees are concerned and smiling. Food is fresh delicious. I didn't like the Lahmacun very much.,0
Portions are big. The flavors are nice. Service is fast. Prices are normal. I recommend.,0
A successful business. It's pretty good in food. Prices could be a little more reasonable.,0
The ingredients used in the dishes were of very high quality. Really clean; decent and beautiful place.,0
The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious... The service staff is very caring and attentive...,0
Don't be fooled by the menus seen in the pictures. It seems less and smaller. I did not like the business; I do not recommend.,0
Covered doner kebab pita is also really delicious in lahmacun with cubed cheddar... The attention and care of the employees is extraordinary.,0
A delicious and clean place.,0
Reviews are misleading; I definitely do not recommend. Too bad.,0
Meals were prepared neatly and cleanly. It was a pleasant dining experience in a decent place. Thank you very much.,0
The appetizer plates were very nice; we were very pleased that we went. We ordered 6 types of appetizers; lahmacun and stuffed meatballs. For dessert; we ordered burma kadayif and kÃ¼nefe.,0
The taste of the food was good; but the prices were high according to the portion. Waiters tend to take the plate as soon as they eat; so people cannot reach the satisfaction of eating.,0
I ate lahmacun; so it was good.,0
The service is fast; the employees know the region and the cuisine well. Their lahmacun is very small in portion; the size of a hazelnut lahmacun.,0
Thank you very much for bringing the flavors of Antakya here.,0
The prices are reasonable; the employees are concerned and polite; the flavors are good.,0
Appetizers were good. The size of the lahmacun was good; Even though I ordered spicy; it came painless.,0
I tried it today. It was a place that I really liked. The appetizers were very good; I got the minced meat kebab; it was very successful. Staff was very attentive and service was fast.,0
There were burnt livers on the liver skewers; and there were uncooked parts in the chops. Good overall taste. Tripe soup is delicious.,0
It is a historical place. It is one of the oldest and well-known businesses in Antalya. There are delicious soups; home cooked meals; pita kebabs and doner kebabs. Prices are a little expensive.,0
We went for the tripe soup. I do not recommend; I did not like it; I ate better.,0
The lack of tea in such a high quality and crowded place is a big shortcoming. Waiters didn't care about us.,0
We can say that trotter soup is good. Rotary medium. Inside the restaurant it was very quiet. The staff is fast.,0
The ambiance is large and airy. The waiters are attentive and the service is fast. The tomato paste goes well with the trotter. The price is very reasonable.,0
A nice cozy place. It is easily accessible from all parts of the city. It is very interesting that the restaurant does not have a menu.,0
Perfect taste; same taste same taste every time I go. It's just that it's very busy; so the employees can't care much and the tea service is closed during the busy time.,0
Good place. Meals were good. Service is also good. There is parking in front for cars.,0
Very bad business. We were removed from the table because it was time for iftar.,0
Thank you for amazing dishes.,0
The fish served to me was almost raw; I couldn't eat it. A place that does not care about customer satisfaction.,0
I only liked the soup in the place; the fish It was very tasteless and unsalted. We ate fish bread and the bread was full of lettuce.,0
A decent place. You can eat as a family. You can eat many kinds of fish as grilled; fried or stewed.,0
Prices are not expensive; Mersin is a place where you can eat fish comfortably in the city; I recommend the fish soup.,0
Ambiance is a little bit old; but it is okay.,0
The employees are uneducated and sullen. Fish bread is not good; but fish soup is good. You can go to the restaurant for fish soup.,0
Great place and fish; thanks to the amazing chefs,0
Nice fish place; beware of the cats though.,0
The toilets were very dirty; other than that the food was good.,0
I like fishes especially in this restourant. I ate sea bass and it was great.,0
Food was good; delicious. Including soup. But there was hair in the salad.,0
I tried mumbar and stuffed meatballs; their taste was legendary. the environment of the shop was wonderful; the attention of the staff to the customers was good.,0
Everything was amazing; thank you Yesemek! I ate yuvarlama and mumbar.,0
As someone who tasted Gaziantep cuisine for the first time; I can say that I was amazed. We ordered 2 different trays in order to taste all their local dishes. One had soups and the other had appetizers. The flavors are delicious. It is definitely my recommendation.,0
Expensive but it is does not matter; flavors was amazing!,0
I had a nice dining experience. I tasted the local flavors of Gaziantep; they were good.,0
"The place is nice; Mumbar was smelling bad and the stone came out, I didn't eat it. The mince in the icli kofte was bad; sour. It's also an expensive restaurant.",0
They have very good soups and appetizers; including Beyran. Everything was fantastic. Oh my god Gaziantep!,0
Customer care is very good. We ordered the tasting plates and each one was excellent flavors.,0
It's a great place in terms of taste. The service is fast and the waiters are friendly. It's a bit expensive in terms of price; but you should definitely come and taste these flavors.,0
The food was delicious but not as exaggerated in other reviews or did not appeal to my taste. The environment is quite nice. The place was noisy because it was crowded.,0
Menu was like that; Recommend.,0
The attitude of the waiters towards the customer was cold.,0
Service was nice; I've tried everything on the menu over time and it's all very good. Prices are very cheap; you should definitely come.,0
Soup and tenderloin were delicious. Staff involved. Prices are reasonable.,0
Excellent food and ambiance.,0
Soups and pitas are incredibly delicious and the portions are hearty. The staff is very caring and smiling. Prices are reasonable.,0
Waiters didn't pay attention to me.,0
Friendly waiters; nice service and delicious food. In addition; the price is also affordable.,0
I can not say foods are bad but quality of foods can improve. Service is slow.,0
Everything was delicious. Business personnel were also friendly.,0
I used to come to this restaurant a lot. The flavors used to be better. I think the chef has changed.,0
We ordered the village breakfast for 2 people. The ones that came were quite enough and delicious. Also; the ravioli was very good.,0
Bazlama and menemen were delicious. The place was not clean so I did not have a pleasant dining experience.,0
The most delicious and sincere place to eat in Fethiye. A small family restaurant. I especially liked the veggie pancakes. I strongly recommend.,0
Delicious foods. I think place has to more cleaner.,0
Menemen is delicious. Homemade jams are very good. Vegetables were not very fresh.,0
It does not bad. The best part was if the price wasn't affordable.,0
The place is very cozy; the food was fresh and good. They served pickles and tea; both were delicious.,0
Home cooking is not bad in terms of taste. We waited about an hour for the manti to eat. Also; the place is a little small.,0
Turkish sarma was really tasty; liked it.,0
Turkish pasty was really tasty.,0
I didn't like the food very much because it was too salty.,0
Credit card is not accepted. The flavors are good.,0
The sauces are very tasty. People are friendly and the place is very clean.,0
The food is good but I got really bored after waiting about 45 minutes.,0
We ordered the Atom box (70 TL). Only cash payment option is available. They're pretty intense. The flavors are good.,0
The irresistible taste of chicken; sauce and spice that has been increasing for years.,0
Chicken pan and salad were okay; but not as exaggerated as other reviews.,0
Definitely the chicken and the side salads are also very tasty. Prices are cheap compared to this kind of touristic place. The place was a little crowded.,0
Place was not clear.,0
Sandwich's souce was pretty tasty.,0
Super delicious chicken; best in town.,0
The pos device cannot be used; so they only accept cash payments. I think this creates a problem in terms of hygiene.,0
We ordered stuffed mumbar; artichokes; liked and tamarind sherbet. All of them were good in taste; quality of materials and presentation.,0
It is one of the must-visit places with its menu that changes every day and includes original local delicacies from all over Turkey. The poppy and pistachio kebabs are a must try.,0
We really liked our orders. There were dishes on the menu that I have never tried in my life; nice variety.,0
Waiters were not very good.,0
Famous place; fast service; caring staff; the taste of the sherbet we tried for the first time was legendary.,0
Our choice was Antep style lahmacun; since I ate it last time; I found it very dry inside; unfortunately the taste of garlic was barely felt. The cleanliness of the place was good.,0
The variety is plentiful. Pretty clean and decent. They make very good dishes from the southeast of our country.,0
Today we had the opportunity to try the stuffed meatballs and lahmacun. We could not taste the meat at all because the cumin in the stuffen meatballs was too much. Lahmacun is good.,0
The waiters are generally very sullen and unhappy. Service is very slow. Nothing extra comes to the table. Even the starter appetizer; which is available in many kebab shops; does not come. Lahmacun was very dry and tasteless.,0
Food was good overall. The toilets are so dirty; we are disgusted.,0
Everything was excellent. Thank you!,0
A perfect view; a friendly and sincere service and great tastes...what more could you ask for?,0
The view is great. This may be its only good feature. Apart from that; they have extremely rude employees.,0
The food is good. The calamari and seafood are delicious. Nice atmosphere opposite the sea. It would have been better if there was some music playing in the venue.,0
Yummy; delicious and wonderful.. The view is as beautiful as the food.,0
We had dinner in a very stylish place with a beautiful view by the sea. The flavors were perfect.,0
A decent place where you can dine under the trees; accompanied by the moonlight. Employees are friendly.,0
Be sure to ask for all prices in advance. You'd definitely get charged triple the price and these guys will try to scam you in all possible ways. Including overcharging the market price; charging you for double the weight of the fish & serving you a half the fillet and all the bones to charge you for all that.,0
The summer part of the place is stylish and pleasant; the view is wonderful. The food and appetizers are delicious. Prices were a little expensive.,0
Generally good service thank you!,0
Appetizers are great; the view is great; the place is beautiful; the fish is very fresh and delicious.,0
The theme of the place is usually white. This can actually bother the human eye on sunny days; so I think the wrong color was chosen. Fish flavors were average.,0
Food came late; pasta was cold. The waiters couldn't take care of us from taking care of the takeaway.,0
The ingredients used in the salad were rotten; I didn't like it at all.,0
Great chicken; thanks!,2
The taste is fine; but when you wait for the waiter for 15 minutes to order and wait for the food for 15 minutes after placing the order; the taste is meaningless. Waiters were very indifferent.,0
It had nothing to do with the chicken world flavor I knew.,0
Very tasty; I definitely recommend. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the prices are expensive.,0
We ordered cafe de paris; it was delicious; and the price was 35tl.,0
It is very crowded and arrives incredibly late. If you are very hungry; it is better to eat somewhere else.,0
Salad was not very fresh.,0
It was a bit crowded; but it's okay; the flavors were good.,0
Overall everything was delicious; however; we didn't like the eggplant salad; it was too sour and didn't taste like eggplant at all.,0
Raki and fish was good thank you it was super.,0
We went on a Friday and all the tables were full at first. Service; waiters; the ambiance is very nice. The menu was a little expensive.,0
I recommend the liver and Cyprus salad; the appetizers are delicious; the price is good according to the place and the service provided.,0
We had a pleasant time. The ambiance was nice.,0
The smell of the wet wipes was very nice. It's a clean place.,0
We ate nice fishes; thank you.,0
Elite; delicious; central; what more? The most preferred dishes we experienced are sole fish skewers; fried anchovies and shrimp-calamari. They also bring fresh lavash if you want. The sole fish was amazing. Food is also a little pricey.,0
Thanks for the nice service.,0
Nice salad; it was delicious.,0
We randomly decided to stop by and have an ice cream; but we tasted the worst ice cream we've ever had in our lives here. I don't know if it was one of the flavors they used; but the products seemed to be out of date.,0
Have you ever seen a rainbow in these colors?! The 5-year-old boy would draw the umbrella more beautifully; which was said to be made of sugar dough. The cake doesn't even stand up straight. A birthday cake would only be so sloppy.,0
The pastry is very nice . It is more affordable compared to other places. I highly recommend other products.,0
It is clean and hygiene rules have been followed. The products are daily and fresh.  It is very rich in diversity. Every product you are looking for is available. You can shop without thinking at all.,0
Don't order anything at home; they're sending a stale dessert.,0
I didn't like the atmosphere or the decor either. The lower floor is in front of the highway. Trucks are passing by; you're eating pies. It's not nice and it's expensive. Oh; and there are a lot of beggars.,0
My and my 3.5-year-old daughter's favorite place is in Samsun; we love the products of this place the most.,0
They have very high quality cakes; I strongly recommend. Their baklava alone is not that good. Cookies are expensive; but they're fine.,0
They have various and delicious products. Especially the age cakes are very successful. The materials they use in the products are of high quality; the prices are reasonable according to the quality.,0
You won't regret that the products taste very good; but I've never seen such a bad staff before; definitely don't sit down and drink tea and coffee; take the product and leave; that's the most logical thing.,0
it is a very nice place for high quality and special tastes; the employees and the owner are very interested and polite; we are going with love.,0
Chinese salad and spring rolls were okay. I didn't like the veggie noodles very much. The plum sauce of the peking duck was delicious but the presentation was poor.,0
A place with a nice ambiance and delicious sushi. It may be called expensive; but unfortunately; the taste is not affordable.,0
The ambiance of the place is nice but the food is not tasty. I don't think I will come again.,0
When you come to the front of the place; its magnificent exterior design really draws attention and I think it was done very well and I personally liked it very much. The atmosphere is truly magnificent. We tried Chinese food; especially ramen was delicious.,0
"The atmosphere is nice and the food is delicious. We tried noodles, spring rolls; hot and sour soup and an apple dessert.",0
Food was a bit salty due to soy sauce. Prices are in line with the market.,0
The plate in the photo was around 340 TL. Flavors may be a bit difficult for those who will try for the first time.,0
I tried peking duck with orange and soy sauce. It had a somewhat offensive odor. Good in terms of taste.,0
It has cheaper price compared to other chinese restaurants. But the flavors were not that good. What was particularly interesting to me was that the drinks were very expensive.,0
The outside and inside of the restaurant is very well decorated. The ambiance is really nice. We ate sushi; chicken with mushrooms and steamed ravioli. I really liked the sushi and chicken; but I found the ravioli a bit bland.,0
We ate 3 Bentos and 3 Mixed Noodles. We liked everything we ate; it was very tasty. The service was fast; but it was a bit expensive for your information.,0
One of the places in Samsun with the most beautiful view and menu. A place where you can enjoy your dessert and coffee to the full while enjoying the sea view in front.,0
First of all; the service is slow and very late; and there are no crowds. I ordered a bulk profiterole. The portion also had 4 balls the size of nuts; and the chocolate was also tasteless.,0
Atakum Mado... What a need for another word... The taste;  quality of the products are ala. It is very nice that the service staff is kind; solution-oriented. Especially the sensitivity of the company official; it is very nice to be relevant.,0
There is no need to tell Mado at length; it is a clean and beautiful place.  But there is no standard; kadayif burma with pistachios used to be so unique that I would like to eat it everyday. But now sometimes it was burnt; sometimes dry; sometimes uncooked.,0
Well; it was very nice; the service was very fast and the prices are reasonable; I recommend delicious food.,0
I wanted a four-cheese ravioli. It's just that the sauce is nice. Unfortunately; it failed. All of the portions have adapted to the economy; they have shrunk.,0
My guest and I went for dessert;  we waited 10 minutes to get a menu; we placed orders; and we waited another 20 minutes. Of course; one person couldn't make it to the dozens of tables upstairs to work.,0
It may be the most friendly service I have ever encountered in my life.  All the employees were very sweet; caring people. the drinks and food were very tasty and fresh. I will definitely come again.,0
Something strange came out of the ice cream; the teas are stale and boiled; and you have to say an order two or three times; I definitely don't recommend it; it's a pity for your money.,0
The address of quality. The service should be a little faster.,0
Unfortunately; the sorbet desserts are not satisfactory. The air conditioners are not working. It's a humid environment. I hope they fix it.,0
Love this restaurant; thai style and good taste. Clean and good service.. Recommended !,0
I loved the ambiance; welcome and service. We ate pineapple; spicy shrimp; chicken noodles; and chicken pie. A little pricey but nice place.,0
You can taste different flavors on the menus. It's a bit of an expensive place. The waiters are nice.,0
Ambiance were pretty good.,0
I like thailand foods but not like here ones.,0
The food is very good; the employees are very good and smiling. Prices are very reasonable compared to Asian cuisines. I will come here often.,0
Weâ€™ve had a great dinner at this restaurant. The food was delicious; well prepared and nicely seasoned. I did not know much about Thai cuisine; but I enjoyed the meal very much. Plus the atmosphere of the place is relaxing; staff nice and friendly and prices pretty moderate. Perfect spot to eat out with friends in the center of Istanbul. Would love to come back again!,0
Although far easts foods suits my taste; Tom Yum soup was very aromatic and different; I didn't like it.,0
The waiters took care of me. That's why I left the restaurant before I could order.,0
Egg dish was super salty. Beef with veggies was really good. A bit on the pricier side compared with local Turkish food; but when your Thai GF wants a taste of home; hard to argue over price.,0
The staff is very nice. The food is quite delicious.,0
"The environment is nice, the food is delicious, the employees are polite. We ate meatballs in Ä°negÃ¶l. the manti were great.",0
It's an expensive restaurant.,0
I especially recommend wedding soup; stuffed meatballs; manti and InegÃ¶l meatballs.,0
Local dishes and soups are nice.,0
I did not recommend. Bad service.,0
The place is beautiful; the food sucks. Also expensive.,0
We came because the comments were good; we did not regret it. I recommend the beef tenderloin. Home baklava is also very tasty; prices are reasonable.,0
Delicious food; but their toilets are filthy. That's why I'm deducting points.,0
Famous and delicious meatballs.,0
The food is delicious; but we waited 1 hour after ordering and we were extremely hungry.,0
I ate HÃ¼nkar Begendi and cherry pudding. Both were legends. The meat of HÃ¼nkar Begendi was tender.,0
It has been wonderfully designed in its new location in KarakÃ¶y. It's gorgeous inside. Soundproofing I guess. The waiters are very interested and approaching with a smile. The appetizers and great service were very successful. Thanks.,0
A classy place in KarakÃ¶y with its white cloth and good service. Liver lovers should definitely try the liver pan.,0
The location is nice; the menus are varied; the appetizers are delicious; the prices are a little high.,0
Excellent appetizers; great atmosphere; acceptable prices.,0
The place was too noisy. We didn't really enjoy the food in this mess.,0
Some of the seafood starters are successful. Appetizers are small in portion size for one person. Salads do not meet expectations.,0
"I can't say anything negative about the place, the ambiance; the staff; the richness of the food; the appetizers; the taste and the presentation; it's just perfect.. But I'm giving 3 points because it's a very expensive place.",0
We were not satisfied with the service at all. I ordered wine and it came with a little bit of wine in a regular glass.,0
Yummy yummy! Delicious!,2
The treats and the food were really delicious; each of them was not one of those places that would cause you to come to the place and leave unhappy.,0
We came up with the suggestion; everything was very nice.Especially Koksal; who was in the safe; was so interested. Thank you so much for everything.,0
Although it is not as much as an urfa; it is the only place that can eat liver under samsun conditions. Appetizers can be improved. There should definitely be green mint next to the liver; arugula does not suit the liver.,0
The parking area is large; valet service is offered. The welcome at the entrance is good. Attention should be paid to order and cleanliness.,0
The employees are friendly. The prices are also very reasonable according to the food provided. I can call it the first choice in Samsun.,0
The place is quite big; the employees are interested and friendly; this is 2.development 5 skewers and buttermilk cost 105 tl I liked the price as appropriate.,0
Its breakfast is really very good. I would like to especially point out that you do not need to go to Cakalli for Menemen; you can eat the most delicious here. I really like the fried egg too.,0
They've reduced the menus so much that you can't get enough. The service was over.,0
There are a lot of appetizers; the service is fast and the employees are interested; there is a lot of liver servings; but I couldn't catch the taste I wanted; the prices are a little high.,0
The staff is extremely interested; the taste is already a very good place. It is recommended.,0
The food wasn't bad; we got tired of constantly asking for lavash bread; the liver; until the bread came to the table it became like ice.,0
It is a great place for Samsun. The taste; the treats; the semolina dessert with ice cream that comes after the meal; the variety of the menu; the attention and politeness of the waiters are very good.,0
We went to Iftar; especially they praised the appetizers and treats very much; but as can be seen from the photo; it's not good at all. It was an incredible crowd.,0
It's delicious; fast and has friendly staff. Although the price seems a little expensive; it meets this with unlimited tea; dessert service and appetizers.,0
The place is nice; the employees are good. The food is delicious but the human pilfering for extra charge caused me to give it 1 point.,0
Congratulations; everything was very nice and attentive. The treats were too much for the number of people. Cacik is given in aspava in Ankara; this can also be included in the treats; I can say this in addition.,0
The prices were in the 120-140 range. I didn't like Lahmacun. The appetizers were nice.,0
Every time I go; the prices change; I don't like it. But even for the treats; you can go; which comes as many appetizers; tea; etc. as you want.,0
We went for dinner. after 10 minutes; they said do you want meatball; we bought 1 piece; we asked for an account of 32TL; then they reflected it to the account; they put water in the glasses unannounced; they wrote 20TL to the 1.5 liter water on the table. They're not supposed to do it this way.,0
The sauces and uncooked meats of the dishes give the impression of a meal prepared in the mall and not in a kebab restaurant.,0
Very; very expensive extravagant prices. One lahmacun is 85 TL. They charge 25 TL for a glass of buttermilk. All the intertwined tables are almost adjacent.,0
I ate closed doner pita pita were very tasty. Iskender was beautiful. There is a playground for children. Great on treats.,0
Prices are reasonable; foods were delicious.,0
"The place was full of flies and one of them fell into my food. When I asked for my meal to be changed,; they refused.",0
The atmosphere was spacious and the waiters were nice. The meals were very delicious... the prices were reasonable; but the portions were small.,0
The food is super delicious; I especially recommend the fig dessert. Service personnel interest and hygiene were also high.,0
Dirty plates; Waiters was surly.,0
The meals were delicious. Service is fast; transportation is easy; staff is friendly. Prices are quite reasonable.,0
The waiters are scruffy so we didn't feel comfortable eating. The hygiene of the place was also bad.,0
Salad was great; appetizers were good. The degree of cooking of the meat was good. Also the toilets were very clean.,0
Portions were small but expensive.,0
The satisfying menu of local dishes; the taste of the food and the interest of the employees are very good. The advantage is that it is on the road and has its own parking lot.,0
Everything was excellent; especially sea foods!,0
Bosphorus Salad; Shrimp Cizlama were really successful. Orders came to my table quickly.,0
I am a regular at this place; and I love it as a family The food is fantastic; the fish are great!,0
Food was a little expensive but it is ok.,0
Clean place; the service is good; Prices are not very cheap. generally the Arabs are leaving; locals are also present. Service is fast.,0
Portions were quite adequate. Along with your meal comes multiple and delicious appetizers. Seasonal salad was also delicious; vegetables were fresh.,0
A restaurant where you can eat amazing seafood in a great atmosphere in Bursa. Its taste will really surprise you. I would like to remind you that there is no Alcohol in the restaurant. Bon appetit now!,0
We ordered a soup and a portion of haddock. The bread was great; the eggplant paste was also very good. The soup was delicious; the haddock was delicious.,0
The environment is decent; the service is fast and clean. The interior is spacious; the waiters are knowledgeable and respectful.,0
The assortment is exceptionally good. Fish and accompanying appetizers are very diverse and sufficient. Everything was fresh.,0
The place was nice; but be aware of an expensive place.,0
The flavors are still fabulous; Prices may change according to the conditions of the day. But the taste is always great.,0
Their desserts were really good and tasty but the prices were high.,0
We ate an excellent baklava. But the price wasn't perfect.,0
Gaziantep was one of the cities we visited during our trip to Southeast Anatolia. We decided to eat baklava from Kocak Baklava. It is the number ten place for me with its understanding of both quality and service. When I come to Gaziantep again; I want to stop by here again and eat this baklava again.,0
The waiters were extremely indifferent. We asked for peanuts to taste and they added it to the account. However; the head office was very good.,0
The staff; the dessert; the place; the ambiance; everything is very nice. It was the best baklava I have ever eaten in my life!,0
Nice ambiance; tasty and crispy baklava and sobiyet.,0
Great and tasty baklava!,0
They even charge for treats!,0
Even though we went late; the desserts were still fresh and delicious. The employees were also very warm and interested.,0
It's a women-only business. Staff and service are fine. Ambiance and design was good. Food options were few.,0
There are only female employees. The food is great; the price is quite reasonable and the place is very clean.,0
There is little variety of food on the menu. Also; the food on the menu is not very tasty.,0
I think the flavors of the place are overrated. Prices are also normal.,0
First of all; everything on the menu we tasted was quite delicious. The service was fast; the employees were very friendly.,0
A decent place where you can taste local dishes in Cappadocia. You can even go just to try the stuffed zucchini flowers.,0
It is a business that has exactly price performance products. You are eating home-cooked meals in a quiet; spacious and decent place with the service of friendly ladies.,0
Don't raise your expectations too much about the food; they tasted normal.,0
If you want to eat delicious home-cooked meals at an affordable price; definitely stop by during your visit to Cappadocia. The employees are kind and concerned. The environment is nice.,0
Service was great. Recommend and thank you!,0
We had good food in terms of taste; but the portions were small.,0
Treats are good; but I did not find the menu very extensive.,0
Very bad customer satisfaction. The prices are so insane.,0
A good kebab place. The meat is very good; tasty; the meat is well cooked. The treats are sufficient and tasty.,0
It was delicious. Interest and kindness are good. But it was expensive.,0
The attention of the waiters to us was very nice. In addition; it felt pleasant to eat the hot meats.,0
Staff greeted with a smile at the door. The atmosphere was very nice. Delicious appetizers arrived before the meal.,0
Everyone is smilingÄ° the food is delicious. Great place; I recommend it.,0
The treats weren't enough. Also; as you can see in the photo; my food came a little burnt.,0
Thank you for providing quality service in a luxury venue.,0
Great service and reasonable prices. Recommend!,0
We ordered a mixed breakfast for 3 people and they brought it for 2 people. Service quality is very low.,0
Interest in Turkish customers was very low. All waiters were taking care of arab customers.,0
Location view is great. We ate meatballs and kuymak; it was nice. We thought that the dessert and samovar that followed was a treat; but I guess it wasn't.,0
We came across a slightly expensive menu with a magical view overlooking the lake and the Black Sea.,0
The view is beautiful. The food was very bad.,0
A restaurant with a beautiful view. It was nice to have breakfast with this view. The only problem was that the place was a little dirty.,0
Service is fast and friendly. Breakfast for 3 people is 140 TL; so prices are reasonable.,0
Nice foods; nice interest!,0
Food tasted delicious but some of the lamb chops were undercooked. Meatballs were also undercooked. It's a bit of an expensive restaurant.,0
Its meatballs were good. What they served on the side was also good.,0
We encountered a unique presentation. The prices are a little higher than the standard; but when you see the presentation and the quality of the food; you realize it's worth it.,0
Unnecessarily expensive; the Arab is addressing the tourist. good taste.,0
Perfect; a relaxing space. Quality and delicious food.,0
Not bad. Service was ok.,0
The products are good but quite expensive. The place is more interested in tourists.,0
The venue is the track and they didn't care about me.,0
All the food that came to the table was very high quality and delicious. I recommend it to everyone.,0
Affordable prices. Recommend.,2
You can find different tastes. It is open until late at night and serves with nice service.,0
Amazing foods but expensive.,0
A must try place. It is possible to become addicted afterward.,0
Hamburger buns are fresh; The patties are soft and delicious. Their special sauces are delicious; It adds a nice flavor to the burger.,0
I tried the orient burger and cheesburger. Oriental burger was good; but nothing to exaggerate as described. King crab was okay; it felt like I was eating dough balls rather than crab. Mayonnaise was not good.,0
The hamburger patty is very small; but it is very tasty and different with its unique sauce and bread. It was not pleasant that there were no potatoes in the menu.,0
The hamburger patties and sauce were very good. I think their mayonnaise is fabricated mayonnaise; It would be tastier if they made it themselves.,0
Really delicious burgers. The ketchup sauce they make is excellent. The point I want to criticize is the low grammage of the hamburger.,0
Really delicious burger. I would recommend it to everyone. Thanks to the smiling staff.,0
The taste of hamburgers is not as good as exaggerated. It's also an expensive restaurant.,0
The popular boutique burger restaurant of the street. bread; sauce and meatballs are very nice. Thank you.,0
We tried the Rib Burger and the Cheese Burger. They put cheddar cheese in the burger instead of cheddar. This idea seemed a little different to me. The sauce inside the ribs is a little sweet. It's a different flavor.,0
Burgers and fries were delicious. Burger meat came well cooked; I suggest you eat it medium cooked. The sauces are quite different and nice; you should definitely try it.,0
Too expensive; I can cook better. Also; ambiance of the restaurant is old.,0
Prices are reasonable; chickens are delicious; but what is on the menu is not real. They do not serve the same food as the menu.,0
My order was missing sauce; missing desert; missing onion rings; fries were cold and stale; fried legs were stale. What a disgrace!,0
They got my order wrong and got into an argument with me. You are disgusting! Terrible service; mismanagement.,0
Food should have been better cooked I think overall not bad.,0
Everything is delicious; there is a lot and at a good price. Service was nice.,0
The taste is not bad in general; but you can eat better ones in other restaurants.,0
No management; food is cold and bad quality; no ice in coke. Not happy at all. I recommend either change the airport manager or close that branch. Definitely bad service.,0
Classical chicken; not awesome taste but it is ok.,0
The manners of the employees were bad; They didn't even care about me. Bread was stale.,0
I couldn't finish my meal .Bad smell and bad taste. It seems that the chicken is spoiled. I don't know what to say; but you should not eat in this place. I feel bad because I decided to eat from them.,0
Delicious and reasonably priced!,0
The waiters are polite and very interested. The place consists of two concepts; you can eat standing or sitting. The flavors were perfect.,0
Pasta was fresh. There is always a long queue in front of the place. I ate fettuccine Alfredo; The sauce and flavor were good.,0
It was served quickly even though it was crowded. It is not a great taste; but it can be preferred for a quick snack.,0
There are many queues. There is a lack of coordination in the place. Even though you ask for service; they take the bill as soon as the food arrives. Not everyone can eat sitting down; We ate standing.,0
A delicious masterpiece comes out when it is made in a Parmesan wheel; made with fresh pasta dough by hand; and with its beautiful sauces. The price is also quite reasonable.,0
Personally; it's very nice Pasta is made; I tried most of the sauces; they were all very good.,0
It's a very sweet place. Thanks to social media; I learned from there and came. Pasta wasn't bad. In terms of taste; I think it is no different from normal pasta with sauce. The employees are very kind. Order speed is very good. Also; prices are affordable.,0
There are two parts that you can eat standing or sitting; I'm sure it will be much more enjoyable if you eat sitting down. It is served pretty fast. Prices are reasonable compared to peers.,0
Incredibly delicious and fresh; fast service and use of environmentally friendly materials..,0
Pasta is made there; orders are taken and served. All of them are prepared in one place in 20-25 minutes. The taste is good; the service is good and hygienic; I think it is a taste and culture that should be visited and tasted.,0
We went for dessert; but there are also food and breakfast options. It's not a huge venue and it gets pretty busy. We ate moblan; ibiza; strawberry puff pastry desserts. Moblan comes in huge portions. Desserts are very tasty and fresh.,0
Kukis is a great business that is both a bakery and a patisserie. Their cakes and tea are outstanding.,0
Reasonable prices and amazing deserts.,0
The cake was amazing. I recommend it. For those who want to sit and eat there; a big queue is waiting for you.,0
Their products are delicious and the sizes are nice. It is very difficult to take orders from the waiters because it is crowded. In addition; the prices should have been more affordable.,0
Service is fast. Pistachio prince dessert is excellent!,0
The portion of toast was small; never satiated. Desserts were good.,0
Great tastes; the interest of the employees was very good; thank you to them.,0
Desserts are good but waiters are very surly; We were not well received.,0
You should not drink coffee; it tasted very bad. I felt like I was drinking earth. Other than that things are nice.,0
Great venue great food appetizers. I can be a customer from now on.,0
The meals are very good. Especially plevlevisca; soka and dried meat are very successful.,0
I did not like the interior atmosphere; seems a little old to me.,0
The place is quite intimate and the ambiance is very pleasant. Simplicity prevails rather than exaggeration and ostentatiousness.,0
I recommend you try the dried meat. But their beers were a bit expensive.,0
All meals were successful; I recommend.,0
Lipa is a real old style tavern. There is a warm friendly atmosphere. Dry meat was very good.,0
Great and chill place; ambiance was nice too.,0
The atmosphere of the place is very good; the bulgur pilaf with dried meat was very good; the quality of the dried meat is a little low.,0
The variety is less. Rice and dry meat are very good. The ravioli was not good.,0
Beautiful; cute; stylish and delicious food. It's a bit sad that it is used more like a restaurant than a book cafe; as it turns into a restaurant at a certain time of the evening; so they took us to a place in the back.,0
A nice place to drink coffee while reading a book. My meat dish arrived cold first. When I reported this to the waiter; they warmed it up and brought it; and then the meat was dry. I did not see the interest that I expected.,0
A very well designed cafe; The library looks very stylish. The menu is as you can see in the photo.,0
Nice and fresh ambiance.,0
Flat white is very tasty and affordable. The interior of the place is very nicely decorated; I was like amazed.,0
Interior and location are nice; but not as nice as other restaurant of the same company. We bought a strawberry brownie cake; my friend and I both had a bad stomach.,0
I tried coffee and a desert; all of them was not bad.,0
We went a few times for breakfast; we were quite satisfied. The place is really nicely decorated. Breakfast for two was understated and good. The service was smooth and the waiters were kind.,0
We preferred milkshake and smoothie. Chocolate sauce added to the blueberry milkshake. The smoothie is also unrelated to the smoothie; it was quite sour; so it was not fresh.,0
A cafe where books and coffee are combined very well.,0
Ambience is very nice but they don't let you work at the outside tables; that is a negative point.,0
The place is not very big; but there are enough tables outside as well; but we sat inside. The souffles from the name of the place were very nice.,0
This cafÃ© was highly recommended by an Istanbul-based blogger for its soufflÃ©s. The unique 2D interiors and decorations caught my eye as soon as I entered. I opted for the Chocolate with Orange soufflÃ©; while my husband chose the Chocolate with Blueberries. I must say; the taste was absolutely amazing.,0
This is one of my favorite cafes in Istanbul. As you can see on the menu; the soufflÃ©s are about 100 TL; the drinks could be more appropriate.,0
I can say that the lack of lactose-free milk is a big deficiency for me. Desserts were good.,0
Tasty; delicious soufflÃ©s!,2
There was a queue and the cafe was small. So you have to be willing to wait in line. But it was still a good experience for us. The soufflÃ© was very sugary and after eating a little bit of mister. The gifts given were also very sweet and took us back to our childhood.,0
It's a very small and elegant place; its decor attracted me as I passed by. This cafe specializes in souffles of various flavors and the service they have is excellent and the staff are welcoming and cheerful.,0
Overrated souffles. It wasn't as nice as I expected.,0
I ordered the banana & white chocolate souffle. It was a little small but very tasty. They serve it with ice cream. The staff is also very polite and smiling.,0
It was worth getting up and going from Beylikduzu. Atmosphere 10/10,0
This is one of the best sufles Iâ€™ve ever eaten. Although it was package service; I like the presentation; taste and texture of the chocolate. Thank you Suflor Team! ,0
As a doner lover; it met my expectations in terms of price; taste and service. It is sure to increase the flavor in wood fire.,0
Service was bad. I think a few treats should be given.,0
High aroma. It is cooked completely on wood fire and without gas fueling. It turns very well.,0
Great doner; I liked it. Portions of it was enough too.,0
Seriously cheap and affordable price for those who want to eat delicious meat doner kebab.,0
Doner was overcooked so it was dry. We ordered ayran; it came late.,0
Price performance was satisfactory. Although it was wood fired it could have been better. Maybe doner can be asked to be a little more cooked.,0
The hygiene of the place was not very good.,0
Ambiance of the place is old and neglected. Doner was ok.,0
Its wood-fired doner kebab tastes different; it's one of the best doner meats in this area; and it's affordable; too. Congratulations to the business. I will visit once again.,0
The meat is DELICIOUS; the price is reasonable; but the service is poor.,0
Definitely do not go without a reservation; it was overcrowded. We ate very delicious pizzas; but waiting in line for 1 hour didn't make any sense.,0
I don't understand why people wait so long to eat an average pizza.,0
The dough and zucchini of the pizza were very well cooked. The place was a little noisy.,0
You can definitely eat the best pizza in Istanbul here. The location is very nice. A good place both in terms of variety and taste. But the prices are quite high; Be careful.,0
Best pizza in the area; very crowded in weekends.,0
The quality of the pizzas was worse than before. They made me wait for a while even though the tables were empty.,0
There are so many types of pizza; you are surprised which one you want to taste. I found it very successful in terms of taste. Atmosphere and service was good.,0
I tried the smoked ribeye pizza; the dough is thin and very tasty.,0
Crowded and expensive place.,0
No bad. It was very crowded; there was no lighting outside; so we could look at the menu with phone flashlights.,0
Excellent pizza and fine wine. Both food and beverage portions are large. I recommend.,0
"We always stay here when in Valdez for silver salmon fishing. The elderly couple that run it are amazing to talk to, extremely helpful. The campsites are very well maintained.",0
"Great campground for the price. Nice hot unlimited showers, laundy, and spacious wooded lots. Full hook ups. Late check in available.",0
"We tent camped here for 2 nights while exploring Valdez. The center of the campground was in the open and there are treed sites around the edges. Don't expect lower foliage separating the sites. Still this is much nicer than the other RV parking lots in town which seemed wide open. There is a bath house with 1 set of coin operated washer/dryer, 2 restrooms (sink toilet) and 2 shower rooms (sink, toilet, shower). The hot water will run out after a few showers. They provide floor mats towels for you to use which is nice, but they lack vent fans to remove moisture so it is prone to mold. Wi-Fi didn't reach our site on the back edge of the campground. Overall we were happy with our stay at this campground and would stay there again.",0
"This place is just a few miles outside Valdez, which I thought was a bonus. It was surrounded by woods and had some trees throughout the park for shade. The bathrooms were clean and the showers were nice. The dump station was a little underwhelming. Overall, I'm really glad I stayed here and not one of the gravel lots in valdez.",0
Probably the nicest and cleanest campground we've been to in Alaska.,0
"Great, slept like a bear. Clean, convenient, cute, the owners are a hoot.",0
It is always a treat to visit this rain or shine. So much to say but I'll sum it up with photos.,0
Only 3 booths with mainly vegetables. More expensive than the stores but the produce looked pretty good. The tomatoes were a nice deep red. Tomorrow I'll see if they taste better. I'm trying to eat healthier. I miss the fruits tho'.,0
Not a lot going on here since it moved from downtown. Check out a farmers market somewhere else. Try find where Grandma Wei moved to!,0
It's a market,2
"Great help, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. I was impress by the turn around time, and the fact that he was able to service my trailer so quickly. Other shops in my area were telling me that an appointment were a month out, I got serviced in two days. It was worth the trip from Anchorage. Give Max a call!",0
Matt was honest and did the work done as promised date.,0
"Max at Happy Camper is the best. Happy Camper installed a generator for my 5th wheel, great work. I was so pleased that I have taken my rig back for a slide out repair. No worries here.",0
"Always great service, honest and fast.",0
Probably the best service in the Valley.,0
It is the most beautiful awesome clean smelling air that I have ever came back to from down south and you will never find another place like it,0
Didn't see it,2
"Didn't rent a room here because of the ""run-around."" Could barely get ahold of the owner. And, when I did, he was in Texas! I still couldn't rent a room because, there wasn't anyone else that could do the paperwork. If you rent from here, make sure the owner is available, and has the staff needed to handle your concerns.",0
"Was a really good experience, the hotel management was pleasant and very helpful. Bathroom and kitchen area was clean and not in disrepair. The only thing I could say I didn't like was the big huge windows that let everyone see into the place, but that's not the worst thing to have. Definitely give this place a try if it's what you're looking for.",0
Nice Room. Get to Know Other Guest. Makes aBetter Stay Being Considerate and Friendly!,0
Compared to the other taxi companies in Anchorage these guys were great. The communication I got was outstanding.,0
Because my review was submitted at a certain time does not mean it was the time of my experience which happened 2 days before I posted my reveiw,0
First class service. A delight to find in a taxi service.,0
"WOW... Did this company really just release someone's personal number...? That seems very unprofessional. Let me get this straight. You got a bad review, and lashed out with someone's personal info? Say there, what's your number? I'd like to share it with.... NO ONE! Because that doesn't seem right.",0
Numbers down not sure of this company is still in buisness.,0
Said they wonâ€™t come to old Seward and 70th donâ€™t have service in that area,0
Couldn't get through to dispatch and did not use due to this.,0
Very quick to respond with a taxi after requesting one. Seems like a good alternative to yellow and checker cabs.,0
"Very rude people. I had to call back and ask for a taxi that would fit 4 adult and a kid, the man who answered rudely said you know what we canâ€™t keep sending taxis out to you just call someone else. No one even came out and showed up. So how would it hurt to send someone with a bigger car. Very disrespectful. Donâ€™t take this cab company just can yellow cab their much nicer. If I could rate this zero stars I would",0
"Worst service ever. Save your time, use Ubee or Lfty.",0
Quality local radio. Lots of awesome live performaces from Alaskan artists here. A nice place where nice people are.,0
"The KTOO building houses KTOO, KXLL and KRNN, our local public radio stations. The building has several recording studios as well as a public studio space which can be used for public broadcasts or events. KTOO is also home to 360 North, a television station focused on public and regional affairs. Gavel Alaska is a service of KTOO that brings coverage of the geographically isolated state legislature to remote parts of the state. Everyone in the building is super friendly and helpful, like they're all characters from some 1970's episode of Sesame Street.",0
Great staff as well as divergent programming! Love to listen to the station!,0
"Attended a Chamber event here in the studio, the location, staff and all settings were top notch.",0
Flagship public media center for Southeast Alaska,0
"Old school, but my favorite pool in Juneau for what I do (mostly laps).",0
"I love this pool. It's an old facility and doesn't have a lot of fancy stuff, but it does its job being a center of community very well.",0
Favorite spot downtown for the kids,0
It's one of my favorite shops in Juneau. There is so much to discover and you couldn't find nicer people to help you. It's locally owned and a huge supporter of Juneau! It's a true gem in Downtown Juneau!,0
One of my favorite stores in all of Alaska. Every visit to Juneau calls for a visit however brief it may be to Kindred Post. They have the very best greeting cards and post cards. Plus they make it so easy to mail just about anything. The staff here are always so welcoming and warm. The very best of Juneau!!,0
Awesome! A post office? Sure. But the quality of goods they have for sale here is like nothing I've seen anywhere else. Looking for a gift to give to family back home? This place is great. A slice of individuality in an area with lots of the same stuff for sale.,0
"Best post office ever! Great location; quick, friendly service; delightful art, unique gifts and souvenirs. Popular with locals and tourists alike.",0

"Great staff, creative and challenging rooms and puzzles, this place is fun. I've done two of the rooms they have and have had different experiences each time. The attention to detail is amazing and the work is all personally created by the owner. The rooms have incredible sets with clues hidden in plain sight and others hidden right under your nose but you don't notice them until some clue leads to another clue to another until it finally fits and tadaa a lock opens. I am looking forward to the next escape.",0
"This was my first visit to an escape room, and I went with a group of 12 (myself and 11 others) in the large room. It went fairly well, there was enough things for all of us to do something, and nothing was totally arbitrary. We did wind up being straight up given a few lock combinations, and pretty obvious hints (after a few related ones ""the person in the red hoodie has the map"") where we were quite thick. Overall, I'd go back and do a different room, the puzzles were fun and all of us had a good time. For that large room, probably fewer could solve it, though it still works well with a large group, with none of us having done something similar before.",0
Great fun and team building experience for our family!,0

"Dr. Ben and his staff were great! Got my first crown on my tooth and it was a quick and painless process. Highly recommend you take the whole family at any age, they're great with kids too!",0
"Absolutely love this dentist office. Brought my daughter to get an exam and a teeth cleaning. Everyone was very friendly, i would recommend them to anyone.",0
"Thanks Dr. Ben for the great experience you continue to provide for all of our childrenâ€™s dental needs over the past five years! Your hygentist (Tom), and front desk staff are always welcoming, kind, and knowledge! My 8 year-old daughter was amazed at how pleasant her experience was with getting a filling. Laughing gas, movie/headphones, and blanket contributed to an amazing experience. She actually had fun at the dentist! Thanks for making it as pleasant as possible to have dental needs met!",0
"Pleasant friendly, and EXPENSIVE!",0
"2015: 7am appointments fit my schedule. Paraffin hand wax feels great. I work with the same hygienist every time, which I really like. // 2016 still great. I had a filling today and I felt they really worked to make it as pleasant as possible. // 2019 edit: still love this place",0
I've been going here for years and love it. I've sent many friends and my husband here as well. Everyone is so nice and good at making you feel comfortable. 10/10 would reccomend!,0
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They are always checking on my comfort and very attentive to my needs. Thanks ya'll!,0
"This place is a dental unicorn. I've never met nicer, more authentic folks. They genuinely care, and while I had some major work done, it was pretty painless. We are fortunate to have them in Anchorage.",0
"They have a very friendly staff that were very competent. I love their system of being able to fill out paperwork online before you get there. They print it out for you and all you have to do is sign it. I saw a sign that said they do complimentary neck massage, have massage chairs, etc, but I wasn't offered any of that. I certainly didn't need it though. I had Dan as my hygienist and Dr. Mishler as my dentist. Both were great and I had a very nice experience. The front office staff have been very friendly and helpful as well. Overall, definitely a place I would recommend.",0
"Every time I visit Dr. Mishler/Dr. Just's office, I am greeted as though an old friend. I stepped away for about 4 years because of finances. Their office was not pushy or nosy. They simply sent out cards to remind me they were there to help when I was ready. My first visit back, Gwynne the receptionist, didn't miss a beat. She knew me by name as if she had just seen me yesterday. Daniel Walker is one of the best dental hygienists there is. He is the main reason I came back to their office since I no longer live or work anywhere near. The dentists are wonderful but Daniel is very very gentle on your gums and teeth. He is not judgemental about your lack of brushing and will still encourage good behaviors. I love the country music Fridays, the heated neck wraps, and the sun glasses to keep your eyes protected at all times!",0
"Tom was amazing! He made me feel very relaxed, welcomed and appreciated. I totally recommend him.",0
Monica was a fabulous and informative dental hygienist. I really appreciated how welcomed she made me felt as well as giving me detailed explanations to all my questions.,0
"Great place, super staff. I had a emergency and they got me right in. I 've had to cancel multiple times on my cleaning due to work schedule and they have been great about that too.They have days that they are open till 7:00 pm which I just found out, looks like now I can keep those cleaning appts.",0
I love the people there. So professional and personal.,0
"I absolutely had to write a review for this company. Janice was so spectacular for us from start to finish. We wanted to purchase a home in what was probably an unrealistically quick time frame, and Janice relentlessly tackled the task for us, making sure that we found the home that we desired for the price we wanted and in the time that we needed. We were constantly pleasantly surprised at how hard she worked and how much she cared. She was on the ball 24-7 for us throughout the entire process. Professional, communicative, just perfect. If you desire a realtor that will work hard for you and that genuinely cares, then call Janice at Century 21 today, I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",0
"Janice and her team at Alaska Premier Real Estate went above and beyond when helping me with my real estate transaction as a first time home buyer. Janice and her team helped me through every step of the process, from the search for my family's perfect home to closing the transaction with keys to the house in hand. I would (and have!) recommend Alaska Premier Real Estate when it comes to your Real Estate needs.",0
"I had an awesome experience! They were all so nice and friendly! Always helpful, knowledgeable. The only office I'll call with my Real Estate needs!",0

"Jennifer Rath helped us find our dream retirement property. Now Jennifer, Janice and their team are helping us sell our house. VERY pleasant experience working with them!",0
Very difficult to navigate the web site. Required to create account just to find anything out. Couldn't locate the house in question and ended up calling them to get a recording. Called my personal realtor to get the information needed.,0
"Great store. They didn't have what I was looking for when I went, but they had tons of stuff for house work which looked very helpful. I'll definitely go back.",0
Very great customer service given the current situation with Covid. Very helpful and friendly,0

"DO NOT GO HERE. I used Stevens Glass for a driverâ€™s side door window replacement. Due to their negligence and poor quality repairs I eventually had to replace the entire interior door panel to my truck (a costly claim to my insurance company). First, when they replaced the window the weather stripping was damaged, scratching the newly replaced glass/tint. I returned and requested they repair the weather stripping - their solution was to bend the weather stripping back into place, instead of replacing it or repairing it correctly (leaving a large bend in the plastic). When I rolled the window down to test this repair, I realized the Rogerâ€™s Glass employee had somehow bent the interior door panel in their repairs, resulting in increased pressure on the window and causing it to pop off of its frame / motor and drop down into the interior of my door. So I returned a third time to give them an opportunity to correct the issue. Staff insisted the failed repairs were due to a gluing issue and did not address the bent door panel and instead re-glued the window (applied a large amount of two-part epoxy to the window and window frame). I described to them how I noticed the bent door panel was applying pressure to the window. The window motor made more noise because of the increased work to move the window up and down. Also, as the window rolled down it tilted inside the truck. The staff completely ignored my comments and these obvious signs of damage. At this point, I did not feel confident in the shopâ€™s ability to repair my truck and contacted my insurance company to submit a claim. The window and door panel were correctly repaired at local auto body shop. With the door dismantled, I was able to see the interior of my door and my suspicions of poor repair were confirmed. With the damaged door panel replaced, the window now rolls down without tilting forward or the sounds of a struggling motor.",0
"Got in and out real quick with new wiper blades too, and reasonable. Wonderful people too.",0
The installers were amazing. They adjusted our shower glass to the millimeter and cleaned up after themselves. They were also professional and polite! Also the glass product was beautiful. This is a great company to do business with if you need glass!,0
Excellent friendly customer service - thank yOu!,0
I was happy with the quality of work along with friendly customer service throughout the process.,0
Always go to guys great service,0
OMG this is one of the best glass places I have used it's family owned and they treat you like your there only customer and they have the best prices I have came across,0
Poor experience with the manager. Decided to use another service provider due to the manager being unreasonable.,0

"We always stay here when in Valdez for silver salmon fishing. The elderly couple that run it are amazing to talk to, extremely helpful. The campsites are very well maintained.",0
"Great campground for the price. Nice hot unlimited showers, laundy, and spacious wooded lots. Full hook ups. Late check in available.",0
"We tent camped here for 2 nights while exploring Valdez. The center of the campground was in the open and there are treed sites around the edges. Don't expect lower foliage separating the sites. Still this is much nicer than the other RV parking lots in town which seemed wide open. There is a bath house with 1 set of coin operated washer/dryer, 2 restrooms (sink toilet) and 2 shower rooms (sink, toilet, shower). The hot water will run out after a few showers. They provide floor mats towels for you to use which is nice, but they lack vent fans to remove moisture so it is prone to mold. Wi-Fi didn't reach our site on the back edge of the campground. Overall we were happy with our stay at this campground and would stay there again.",0
"This place is just a few miles outside Valdez, which I thought was a bonus. It was surrounded by woods and had some trees throughout the park for shade. The bathrooms were clean and the showers were nice. The dump station was a little underwhelming. Overall, I'm really glad I stayed here and not one of the gravel lots in valdez.",0
Probably the nicest and cleanest campground we've been to in Alaska.,0
"Great, slept like a bear. Clean, convenient, cute, the owners are a hoot.",0
It is always a treat to visit this rain or shine. So much to say but I'll sum it up with photos.,0
Only 3 booths with mainly vegetables. More expensive than the stores but the produce looked pretty good. The tomatoes were a nice deep red. Tomorrow I'll see if they taste better. I'm trying to eat healthier. I miss the fruits tho'.,0
Not a lot going on here since it moved from downtown. Check out a farmers market somewhere else. Try find where Grandma Wei moved to!,0
It's a market,2
"Great help, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. I was impress by the turn around time, and the fact that he was able to service my trailer so quickly. Other shops in my area were telling me that an appointment were a month out, I got serviced in two days. It was worth the trip from Anchorage. Give Max a call!",0
Matt was honest and did the work done as promised date.,0
"Max at Happy Camper is the best. Happy Camper installed a generator for my 5th wheel, great work. I was so pleased that I have taken my rig back for a slide out repair. No worries here.",0
"Always great service, honest and fast.",0
Probably the best service in the Valley.,0
It is the most beautiful awesome clean smelling air that I have ever came back to from down south and you will never find another place like it,0
Didn't see it,2
"Didn't rent a room here because of the ""run-around."" Could barely get ahold of the owner. And, when I did, he was in Texas! I still couldn't rent a room because, there wasn't anyone else that could do the paperwork. If you rent from here, make sure the owner is available, and has the staff needed to handle your concerns.",0
"Was a really good experience, the hotel management was pleasant and very helpful. Bathroom and kitchen area was clean and not in disrepair. The only thing I could say I didn't like was the big huge windows that let everyone see into the place, but that's not the worst thing to have. Definitely give this place a try if it's what you're looking for.",0
Nice Room. Get to Know Other Guest. Makes aBetter Stay Being Considerate and Friendly!,0
Compared to the other taxi companies in Anchorage these guys were great. The communication I got was outstanding.,0
Because my review was submitted at a certain time does not mean it was the time of my experience which happened 2 days before I posted my reveiw,0
First class service. A delight to find in a taxi service.,0
"WOW... Did this company really just release someone's personal number...? That seems very unprofessional. Let me get this straight. You got a bad review, and lashed out with someone's personal info? Say there, what's your number? I'd like to share it with.... NO ONE! Because that doesn't seem right.",0
Numbers down not sure of this company is still in buisness.,0
Said they wonâ€™t come to old Seward and 70th donâ€™t have service in that area,0
Couldn't get through to dispatch and did not use due to this.,0
Very quick to respond with a taxi after requesting one. Seems like a good alternative to yellow and checker cabs.,0
"Very rude people. I had to call back and ask for a taxi that would fit 4 adult and a kid, the man who answered rudely said you know what we canâ€™t keep sending taxis out to you just call someone else. No one even came out and showed up. So how would it hurt to send someone with a bigger car. Very disrespectful. Donâ€™t take this cab company just can yellow cab their much nicer. If I could rate this zero stars I would",0
"Worst service ever. Save your time, use Ubee or Lfty.",0
Quality local radio. Lots of awesome live performaces from Alaskan artists here. A nice place where nice people are.,0
"The KTOO building houses KTOO, KXLL and KRNN, our local public radio stations. The building has several recording studios as well as a public studio space which can be used for public broadcasts or events. KTOO is also home to 360 North, a television station focused on public and regional affairs. Gavel Alaska is a service of KTOO that brings coverage of the geographically isolated state legislature to remote parts of the state. Everyone in the building is super friendly and helpful, like they're all characters from some 1970's episode of Sesame Street.",0

It's one of my favorite shops in Juneau. There is so much to discover and you couldn't find nicer people to help you. It's locally owned and a huge supporter of Juneau! It's a true gem in Downtown Juneau!,0
One of my favorite stores in all of Alaska. Every visit to Juneau calls for a visit however brief it may be to Kindred Post. They have the very best greeting cards and post cards. Plus they make it so easy to mail just about anything. The staff here are always so welcoming and warm. The very best of Juneau!!,0
Awesome! A post office? Sure. But the quality of goods they have for sale here is like nothing I've seen anywhere else. Looking for a gift to give to family back home? This place is great. A slice of individuality in an area with lots of the same stuff for sale.,0

The attention to detail is amazing and the work is all personally created by the owner. The rooms have incredible sets with clues hidden in plain sight and others hidden right under your nose but you don't notice them until some clue leads to another clue to another until it finally fits and tadaa a lock opens. I am looking forward to the next escape.",0
"This was my first visit to an escape room, and I went with a group of 12 (myself and 11 others) in the large room. It went fairly well, there was enough things for all of us to do something, and nothing was totally arbitrary. We did wind up being straight up given a few lock combinations, and pretty obvious hints (after a few related ones ""the person in the red hoodie has the map"") where we were quite thick. Overall, I'd go back and do a different room, the puzzles were fun and all of us had a good time. For that large room, probably fewer could solve it, though it still works well with a large group, with none of us having done something similar before.",0
Great fun and team building experience for our family!,0
Lots of fun!,2

Awesome service! Everyone I have worked with at peak health has been fantastic and my teeth are feeling great. I absolutely recommend peak health dentistry if you are looking for a dental clinic.,0
"Dr. Ben and his staff were great! Got my first crown on my tooth and it was a quick and painless process. Highly recommend you take the whole family at any age, they're great with kids too!",0
"Absolutely love this dentist office. Brought my daughter to get an exam and a teeth cleaning. Everyone was very friendly, i would recommend them to anyone.",0
"Thanks Dr. Ben for the great experience you continue to provide for all of our childrenâ€™s dental needs over the past five years! Your hygentist (Tom), and front desk staff are always welcoming, kind, and knowledge! My 8 year-old daughter was amazed at how pleasant her experience was with getting a filling. Laughing gas, movie/headphones, and blanket contributed to an amazing experience. She actually had fun at the dentist! Thanks for making it as pleasant as possible to have dental needs met!",0
"Pleasant friendly, and EXPENSIVE!",0
"2015: 7am appointments fit my schedule. Paraffin hand wax feels great. I work with the same hygienist every time, which I really like. // 2016 still great. I had a filling today and I felt they really worked to make it as pleasant as possible. // 2019 edit: still love this place",0
I've been going here for years and love it. I've sent many friends and my husband here as well. Everyone is so nice and good at making you feel comfortable. 10/10 would reccomend!,0
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They are always checking on my comfort and very attentive to my needs. Thanks ya'll!,0
"This place is a dental unicorn. I've never met nicer, more authentic folks. They genuinely care, and while I had some major work done, it was pretty painless. We are fortunate to have them in Anchorage.",0
"They have a very friendly staff that were very competent. I love their system of being able to fill out paperwork online before you get there. They print it out for you and all you have to do is sign it. I saw a sign that said they do complimentary neck massage, have massage chairs, etc, but I wasn't offered any of that. I certainly didn't need it though. I had Dan as my hygienist and Dr. Mishler as my dentist. Both were great and I had a very nice experience. The front office staff have been very friendly and helpful as well. Overall, definitely a place I would recommend.",0
"Every time I visit Dr. Mishler/Dr. Just's office, I am greeted as though an old friend. I stepped away for about 4 years because of finances. Their office was not pushy or nosy. They simply sent out cards to remind me they were there to help when I was ready. My first visit back, Gwynne the receptionist, didn't miss a beat. She knew me by name as if she had just seen me yesterday. Daniel Walker is one of the best dental hygienists there is. He is the main reason I came back to their office since I no longer live or work anywhere near. The dentists are wonderful but Daniel is very very gentle on your gums and teeth. He is not judgemental about your lack of brushing and will still encourage good behaviors. I love the country music Fridays, the heated neck wraps, and the sun glasses to keep your eyes protected at all times!",0
"Tom was amazing! He made me feel very relaxed, welcomed and appreciated. I totally recommend him.",0
Monica was a fabulous and informative dental hygienist. I really appreciated how welcomed she made me felt as well as giving me detailed explanations to all my questions.,0
"Great place, super staff. I had a emergency and they got me right in. I 've had to cancel multiple times on my cleaning due to work schedule and they have been great about that too.They have days that they are open till 7:00 pm which I just found out, looks like now I can keep those cleaning appts.",0
I love the people there. So professional and personal.,0
"I absolutely had to write a review for this company. Janice was so spectacular for us from start to finish. We wanted to purchase a home in what was probably an unrealistically quick time frame, and Janice relentlessly tackled the task for us, making sure that we found the home that we desired for the price we wanted and in the time that we needed. We were constantly pleasantly surprised at how hard she worked and how much she cared. She was on the ball 24-7 for us throughout the entire process. Professional, communicative, just perfect. If you desire a realtor that will work hard for you and that genuinely cares, then call Janice at Century 21 today, I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",0
"Janice and her team at Alaska Premier Real Estate went above and beyond when helping me with my real estate transaction as a first time home buyer. Janice and her team helped me through every step of the process, from the search for my family's perfect home to closing the transaction with keys to the house in hand. I would (and have!) recommend Alaska Premier Real Estate when it comes to your Real Estate needs.",0
"I had an awesome experience! They were all so nice and friendly! Always helpful, knowledgeable. The only office I'll call with my Real Estate needs!",0
"Janice sold Us our first home in 2006 and we have been friends ever since. She is a wonderful person to know and a skilled and knowledgeable advocate in the Real Estate Industry. When we finally move home, we will certainly have her help us again.",0
"Jennifer Rath helped us find our dream retirement property. Now Jennifer, Janice and their team are helping us sell our house. VERY pleasant experience working with them!",0
Very difficult to navigate the web site. Required to create account just to find anything out. Couldn't locate the house in question and ended up calling them to get a recording. Called my personal realtor to get the information needed.,0
"Great store. They didn't have what I was looking for when I went, but they had tons of stuff for house work which looked very helpful. I'll definitely go back.",0
Very great customer service given the current situation with Covid. Very helpful and friendly,0
Very nice hardware store! Not as big as the one downtown but it have an amazingly amount of stuff. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.,0

"DO NOT GO HERE. I used Stevens Glass for a driverâ€™s side door window replacement. Due to their negligence and poor quality repairs I eventually had to replace the entire interior door panel to my truck (a costly claim to my insurance company). First, when they replaced the window the weather stripping was damaged, scratching the newly replaced glass/tint. I returned and requested they repair the weather stripping - their solution was to bend the weather stripping back into place, instead of replacing it or repairing it correctly (leaving a large bend in the plastic). When I rolled the window down to test this repair, I realized the Rogerâ€™s Glass employee had somehow bent the interior door panel in their repairs, resulting in increased pressure on the window and causing it to pop off of its frame / motor and drop down into the interior of my door. So I returned a third time to give them an opportunity to correct the issue. Staff insisted the failed repairs were due to a gluing issue and did not address the bent door panel and instead re-glued the window (applied a large amount of two-part epoxy to the window and window frame). I described to them how I noticed the bent door panel was applying pressure to the window. The window motor made more noise because of the increased work to move the window up and down. Also, as the window rolled down it tilted inside the truck. The staff completely ignored my comments and these obvious signs of damage. At this point, I did not feel confident in the shopâ€™s ability to repair my truck and contacted my insurance company to submit a claim. The window and door panel were correctly repaired at local auto body shop. With the door dismantled, I was able to see the interior of my door and my suspicions of poor repair were confirmed. With the damaged door panel replaced, the window now rolls down without tilting forward or the sounds of a struggling motor.",0
"Got in and out real quick with new wiper blades too, and reasonable. Wonderful people too.",0
The installers were amazing. They adjusted our shower glass to the millimeter and cleaned up after themselves. They were also professional and polite! Also the glass product was beautiful. This is a great company to do business with if you need glass!,0
Excellent friendly customer service - thank yOu!,0
I was happy with the quality of work along with friendly customer service throughout the process.,0
Always go to guys great service,0
OMG this is one of the best glass places I have used it's family owned and they treat you like your there only customer and they have the best prices I have came across,0

I was impressed by the high quality of the yarn and other goods in the store. We were helped right away and made to feel welcome. The staff answered all of our questions. They were knowledgeable and friendly.,0
Always a treat to go in and find beautiful yarn and quality needles. Usually a knitting circle happening- I needed a specific yarn to repair an old hat and many of the knitters and the owner went on a hunt for the perfect yarn match. Very community oriented. Also a donation bin for hats and yarn!,0
Excellent shop! Visiting from PA - stopped in Quality and quantity is amazing. Staff friendly and most helpful. Anyone who knits or crochets will find what they need.,0
Love the yarn here!,0
I always love stopping in. Everyone is so kind and helpful.,0
I have a hard time finding what I need here but I do always find something delightful...even if it wasnâ€™t what I needed. The ladies that own this shop are so sweet and helpful!,0
I loved the atmosphere in this quant store. Quality products and authentic employees. A roundtable is stationed in the middle of the store...all are welcome to hang out and work on projects while visiting with crafters that share the love of yarn.,0
The yarn offered here are so beautiful and soft. Needles are high quality and if you need help you can talk with any of the staff and they can help you from a question about a piece you are working now or a piece you want to work on in the future.,0
This place is ALWAYS awesome.,0
Best yarn shop in Anchorage,0
Beautiful little shop. Tons of quality yarn! Excited to go back!,0
Expensive. Although nice yarn. Felt cluckiah,0
"Small store, but lots of stock for the space. Lots of Alaska dyed and spun wool as well as usual commercially available. Lovely sit and knit spaces. Clean and welcoming!",0
Very cute place with good prices and customer service,0
"Yummmm....lots of beautiful, scrumptious yarn. Everytime I walk in, I am greeted with a smile. My questions about a knitting or fiber challenge are always answered.",0
Love this shop and all the wonderful ladies who work there! Friday night sit-and-knit is always a highlight of my week!,0
"We had a bulk of laundry to wash and came across Quantum Lounge. First time here and it is a Beauty. Very clean, has WiFi, a sitting area, and cafe. The workers are amazing. Highly recommend for those in anchorage.",0
"Excellent is the rating I give Quantum Laundry. I am new to digital clothes washing (who isn't?) so was pleased when help was readily available. The knowledgeable and friendly attendant had me lined out in no time. I can honestly say that our clothes returned home much cleaner than if I had used the community washer at our four-plex. The cost was more than I usually shell out but, take into consideration that I bought the wash and the pre-measured soap and softening agents (added after washer door locks) and it seems worth it. Washers and dryers are stacked with the washer on bottom and dryer on top. How much more convenient could this be? There are plenty of them situated in an open-air type arrangement. There is coffee,tea, cold beverages and homemade goodies available at a nominal cost. The restrooms are private, very clean and well-stocked. I think Quantum Laundry will surprise you! This idea is likely to catch on!",0
"I was excited to try out Quantum Laundry after hearinggood things-- and it lived up to my highest hopes! Friendly, helpful staff; convenient payment system; 50lb load washers & dryers available, and great results made this totally worth while. Definitely will recommend to locals & tourists!",0
This is the first time I have had to use a public laundrymat for a long time but my condo burned down a few weeks ago and I looked up other places online and found this one. I am really impressed. Very friendly staff and nice modern equipment to wash and dry your clothes that take credit cards..... the machines will notify you via text and or email if your clothes are nearing completion. I had a relatively small load of clothes to do but could have done a lot more for the same price. The prices seem reasonable as well. I chose a few extras and for a load of clothes in a 30lb washer it was 6.00 and to dry them on Low it was 2.00.. you can add 5:00 for .25 increments The place also has free WIFI and an espresso lounge with snacks etc.... very friendly staff Iâ€™m happy,0
"Went to their soft opening today and it's already one of the best laundromats in Anchorage. Well lit, big screen TVs, Kaladi Bros coffee at the snack bar, and plenty of washers and dryers. Owner told me they think they'll have everything in by March, so this is just a preview. You never have to look for a dryer because there's one right above every washer. The whole thing can be run from your phone, no need to get quarters -- the only place in Anchorage where you can use cards!. The 30lb washers are $4.50 a load, the 50lb washers are $6.50, and dryers are roughly 5 min for $0.25. You have the option on the washers to have unscented soap and color safe bleach ($1), fabric softener ($0.75), and sanitizer (rated for COVID and MRSA, $1) all deposited automatically into the machines, so you can stop hauling jugs of soap with you everywhere",0
"Easy to use the service, helpful staff convent location.",0
Unique experience. Patrons were helpful with info for me and my wife. Got the app and tracking the machine times was easy,0
The laundromat was clean and well organized! Paying with the app is super useful too!,0
Staff here is very nice and curdious. Very clean and up to date laundromat. Don't bring coins they are app based and use credit card and cash bills; nothing wrong with that imo. Can bring your own detergent or use theirs bulit into the machines for $2. In total I used two washing machines and one dryer and cost was about $15. Not a bad price.,0
"Clean, efficient, there is food, wifi, coffee and everyrhing is ran off an app so it's very efficient! You don't even have to bring your own detergent.",0
The machines here are state of the art.,0
"Very modern lounge, brand new washers and dryers they also have brand new covid-19 approved disinfectant that is hooked up with their laundry machine detergent hookup so it's very very sanitary and safe to use. It's also all paperless so no touching dirty money it's all virtual!! Big TV in the building to provide entertainment to you and young ones that may accompy you. There is also a coffee bar that uses koladi brother's as a vendor so it well known good coffee. So stop by and check it out! Should be open to the public for business on Monday Feb 8th from what I'm told about it. Also would be nice to host employee meetings or book club meetings, nice place to grab some coffee and snacks and a good chat with friends",0
"Clean, convenient and the staff is very helpful and friendly. I really like that the have a little lounge/Cafe area and that I don't have to carry around a bunch of quarters. The app is very easy to use as well as the kiosk to pay for the machines. You can use your own detergent or pay extra on the machine if you don't have any.",0
I've been through several dentist over my lifetime. Dr. Wappett by far has been the most gentle Dr. inside my mouth ( hahaha ðŸ˜‚ ) seriously after first visit I'm so glad I made a move! Highly recommend,0
"Clean lobby and bathroom. Dr Wappett is always understanding and listens to any concerns and is always exemplary. Front office and billing staff are always professional. Hygienist are always wonderful. I had an awkward experience with one of the dental assistants but she is no longer there. Over all the staff listen, they are conservative so they wonâ€™t try to do any procedures just to bill for services and make money. They are truly there to provide excellent service and take care of your teeth.",0
"Dr Wappett was an excellent dentist after I got out of the Army and until I had to leave Fairbanks. The hygienists cleaned my teeth thoroughly and without much discomfort. I'd only come twice a year, but surprisingly, Dr Wappett knew who I was. I wish they were here in Anchorage.",0
Great team! From walking in the door I was greeted with smiles & professionalism. Couldn't be happier with this practice.,0
I've never had a bad experience in the 7 plus years I have been a patient. The staff is very professional and always punctual with appt times.,0
Great staff and Dr. Wappett is awesome. I enjoy my visits and love their sense of humor!,0

Has a good cafeteria and coffee shop,0
Wow! All I can say right now is- WOW! The customer service I just experienced was OUT OF THIS WORLD AWESOME! Tonight I went into Alaska Tent and Tarp in hopes to find a couple of one off fasteners in hope I could Jimmy rig a netted dog barrier project for my truck. Not only did they actually have the couple pieces I needed BUT they took the time to listen to me and helped me come up with a solution to my issue. The personalized customer service from Alaska Tent and Tarp should be enough to get you in their front doors.,0
Always great work and helpful staff,0

Amazing job gents thank you!,0

"This was my baby's first time being boarded and away from me, for 8 days total. I had so much anxiety and searched high and low. I gambled on Lakeside Pet Retreat and was rewarded with my decision. The staff upon arrival was diligent with their questions about Brooklyn (my dog) and my concerns over her being old (14) and wanting to be alone. She had her own room with a private patio to go potty in and they even let her have the yard to herself to play. They sent multiple pics every day which was so appreciated and made me feel like my girl was safe and in a healthy environment. 10/10 approve and recommend",0
Best place ever to take your pets! First class care and treatment.,0
I would not take my picky little princess (husky) anywhere else! I love the people and my dog is excited to stay there. That says it all to me.,0
"Could not be more happy or impressed with our experience with them. Professional, great communication, genuine care for our fur baby and regular txt picture updates while we were gone. Fabulous please to trust with your furry family member.",0
Amazing care for our other family members. I love the daily text pictures,0
Good to go.,2
"Great place, very homey, caring environment for pets.",0
Happy staff. Usually get the burrito or the bowl and it's always good. They did have hot cheetos at one point which was really good. A bit pricey though.,0
Very good Mexican food. especially for meal card holders! Can get busy around noon though,0
The food is decent and price is a bit high for what you get. The atmosphere could be better and the could get their name out there better than they have with a bit of effort.,0
Delicious Mexican style food! Very similar to a Qdoba or a chipotle! Itâ€™s free for airman on a meal plan!,0
Relatively expensive. The food menu is very basic.,0
"Food is meh, and the prices are high.",0
"Tasty and most delicious, non Americanized restaurant. The combination of spices is really good. Definitely I will come back. Stop and the people around are very friendly.",0
"Kinda confusing as you come in and it looks like an empty shop with no food in sight. But your nose will tell you you're in for a treat. Sadly, they were out of many dishes--strange, for 5pm on a Tuesday. But our large group ordered samosas, shawermas, and goat and loved it all.",0
This place has some of the best food even if it does not look like it. It doesn't look like much but it is well worth the visit,0
"The food was very good and nicely spiced. The restaurant is quite simple looking, and we assumed the long table down the center was for community seating, no awaiting one really large family.",0
Delicious? Yep! Big Portions? Yep! Great Prices? Yep!,0
"Delicious little hole in the wall! If you want something fancy, this is NOT the place, but if you want something unique and tasty, this is it.",0
"So, so, darn good.",0
Excellent diverse meal,2
Paid 100 for new vehicle inspection. The analysis was good but when I went to pick up my car the ended up loosing the key. Took about 10 minutes but they found it,0
"Solid work, affordable prices, thorough and honest work. I'm grateful Fairbanks has an auto shop of this caliber ðŸ‘",0
"These guys are AMAZING! We LOVE them. They are honest, truthful, and efficient. It takes a while to get an appointment with them, but when they do get you in they get it done quick and right. I can't stress how much we love them. We took our car to Gabe's and he kept it for a week without updating us on what was wrong. When he finally got to us, he said we needed all new brakes. We decided to have Right Choice double check it. They got us in and that same day said that our brakes were fine! They told us why it made that sound and then cleaned them for us. We walked away with a much cheaper bill. We have stayed with them since then and they have always done good by us. Trustworthy is one of the most important traits I look for in car repair, especially up here in Fairbanks. They win first place in my book!!",0
"James is awesome, I've always had positive experiences with Right Choice, the only place I will take my vehicle - honest people :).",0

"I called them for a conex van and the woman quoted me for a price. I asked her if they delivered and she said yes it included delivery. Then..... I went over to purchase the conex and she told me that there was a 250.00 per hour delivery charge!! And. She told me she could not deliver it for a week. The employee that showed me the conex asked me if I wanted it today or tomorrow. So, it was very confusing and I was treated like a red headed stepchild!! Looks like I will not be going back there anymore. No one was wearing masks and everyone was on their cellphones. Very disappointed.",0

"Some good memories. But, don't go past the fence. S0 disgusting.",0

Waiva is an amazing manager i trust my stuff there while i wait for my apartment,0
West side nucka,2
No auto pay,2
Really great nail salon with a little hidden gem Spa called Bello Zero. The massage is beyond comparable to anything I've ever experienced in Alaska. This place offers deep tissue massage and others.,0
"The best attitudes and energy, support your local businesses, I appreciate she puts back into Alaska as I do, hope she has a bright and successful business ðŸ˜Š",0
"Amazing service!

Definitely my new spot! Oh an if you know any nail techs looking for work, they could really use the help..",0
Excellent and super fast! I will be back!,0
I've been to this salon when they opened in November 2019 (grand opening) and I love them! I get shellac polish or regular polish normally.,0
Loved it. Great service and massage and amazing prices!,0
Great service ðŸ‘ðŸ¾,2

Best place in Anchorage for nails,0
Great service ðŸ‘ðŸ¾,2
"The oxtail is so tender, perfect delicious, along with the Vietnamese sandwich, which are made perfect, the right way",0
"Nice clean place and nice people, but they give very little meat for the price, the meat they serve is not that expensive so they should really give more. I had a soup in a big bowl and only had about 8 pieces of meat and some very small. The pho beef is hard meat and small portions again. I don't think I'll go back, maybe in a month or so and hope they change the portions.",0
First time there was positive. Just ordered spring rolls and the fried Beef Jerky. There were 4 Spring Rolls that were a good size and very tasty. The fried Beef Jerky was excellent too... if you like a tasty crunch. It'd be great on a hike. The seasoning included lemon Grass. I will visit them again to try other delicacies. 4 Star rating for now. Will let you know more on my next visit.,0
Gentlemen is always kind thank you...,0
Food ok. Takes long for you to get your food.,0
We had beef brisket and meatballs pho. It's was very delicious and generous portions. Also tried and loved Laotian cucumber salad. The smoothies are thick and very tasty.,0
Awesome fall! I had visited 8 times.,0
"An incredible place to stop by and take a rest while on your way to Valdez. The waterfall is not gigantic but nevertheless beautiful, and the views from that spot are spectacular...",0
"Beautiful place to stop, several waterfalls can be seen from this pullout.",0
I almost think it's prettier than bridal veil falls. It's just around the corner corner with plenty of parking. One must stop when going by.,0
Lots of water!,2
"(Translated by Google) Hard too (Original) Duro, demasiado",0
Wow. Delicious savory meals.. worth every penny. It's good!! Didn't have a single bite that was blegh. I would highly recommend. 5 star...,0
Clean and food is delicious!,0
"Outstanding service and food, my daughter's favorite spot. They have wonderful fried oreo's, and banana chips for dessert..",0
"Great menu, good portions, excellent customer service! Not to mention they have amazing potstickers!",0
Delicious food and nice atmosphere!,0
They were alright for the first time of me being there.,0
The girl who helped me is always very nice!!,0
"Very friendly people, helped us with everything we needed to start ballet.",0
Never felt better,2
"My coat and sweater is clean but they are matted and my sweater was only worn once, cost of cleaning those two items $69 but he told me $60 was fine.. I wknt wear them again",0
"Always very clean, and the best laundry service in South Anchorage!",0
Great service. They'll wash and dry your clothes for 1.95 per pound.,0
"Its clean and convenient location for me. Prices are great, too. However, they run a linen business out of there so when you come, they may be using all the dryers and taking up all the counter space for folding. Seems like they should have their own private equipment and space for their linen business, or separate hours that aren't during public hours. I will probably try another place first, next time.",0
"Please Note, NO washing or drying after 5:30, even though the hours say 7 pm.",0
It's bad for customer and asked for employee looks like stand for not responding for me.,0
Super nice and helpful staff.,0
It is a good place,0
"I enjoy the convenience of the parking garage. You get two free hours to park if your going to be quick, also the garage is under surveillance but you should still lock your vehicle up to keep any belongings safe. Just make sure to remember your downtown and report any suspicious people(s) to the good FPD!ðŸ¤”",0
They knocked down some historic bars to put up this monstrosity. The city was wrong anyway- tearing them down didn't reduce crime in town one bit.,0
I miss the tiki cove but now great place to park,0
Good view above Fairbanks for free.,0
"Convenient, close to everywhere downtown plus 3 hours free every day April 1-October 1",0
I have not been in a Zumies in a long time. It was a fun experience. I found some fun stickers (though I was sad the main one I wanted was folded in the middle). Actually they had quite a few stickers that were like that. Definitely for a trip in. You will find something you will like.,0
Found some nice shoes. Was a nice visit especially with over chatty fellow that kept telling us how much he loved working there.,0
"The people who work there are always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable of the brands. They have assisted me several times in finding clothes for my kiddos.",0
"Store is nice and tidy, some products misplaced and misaligned but still looks nice. Great presentation on new released products and local goods. Regular employees are chill and laidback with a positive attitude, sometimes helping other customers and welcoming them in. I get that itâ€™s a bother to go out of your way to talk to customers, but you gotta ask if they need help lol. Makes it feel like Iâ€™m not welcome or something is wrong with me.",0
Love the longboards and some of the clothes and the watches and chains,0
There's a huge difference between customer service and just flat out acting unlady like flirting with a customers S/O as soon as they separate in the store. Really disrespectful and I will no longer be a customer.,0
Good inventory but overpriced compared to online sources.,0
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE This place! It is God's house and you can feel it. Wonderful Pastor, just an awesome Bible Church.",0
Friendly folks. Wonderful music. Excellent preaching. They even have comfortable seats.,0
Wonderful AWANA program for children run here by loving committed people.,0
"Great place, havenâ€™t personally attended Church. Have been for Right to Life Banquets that were hosted there.",0
The sermon was uplifting,0
God is present here!,0
It's a bit cold inside. Science club is pretty awesome. Lecture by a knowledgeable scientist plus informal pub quiz for a free drink. Food is decent dive food,0
"Great food and drinks in a relatively small, intimate atmosphere.",0
Always friendly staff and excellent quality live music.,0
Good food and great music always happening,0
Triva was a blast and open mic was fun.,0
Good food . GREAT music.,0
"Butt soup ?? drinks , chached out lawyers, you name itðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘.",0
Only went once to see a particular artist. Food was ok,0
Came here for a catered event/venue and the staff did a nice job with the food and drinks.,0
"An awesome way to travel in Southeast Alaska. The crew is excellent and the views are pretty spectacular! If you want to experience the magic of Prinve of Wales Island and need a way to get over, this is the way to do it. Don't forget to have a milkshake on your ride! :)",0
Helpful staff easy to navigate,0
Like how relaxing it is waiting inside while waiting to board ferry.,0
You guys are amazing.,0
Great towing company! Would definitely use them again.,0
Great company to work with. Daut was on time and handled my car with care and professionalism. Hands down best tow company in AK as well as very resonable pricing. Will defently use for future tows.,0
"He is my hero ðŸ™Œ the only tow guy I have ever used that cares and can actually tow modified vehicles without damaging them, also one night I had a bad driver run me off into the snow bank and with the city snowplows only maybe a mile away I was stressed for time, called him at almost midnight and he was there and saved the day before the snowplows got me, only person I be calling for myself or my business ðŸ‘",0
"Had my lowered 370Z towed from my home to a shop. Arrived earlier than expected and was able to get my car on the truck without scraping anything at all, and my car sits a half inch off the ground. If they can get my car on the bed, they can get anything on there. Didnt use the control arms to winch my car up which is a huge problem up here in Alaska! I've seen so many bent control arms due to other companes winching or strapping down from them. Honestly can't beat the service and the price for a tow. In town or not. Not the first time I've called Eagle towing, and definitely not the last! (Well hopefully I dont have to call again! ðŸ˜) thanks again for the great service!",0
"They showed up when they said they would, hooked up my car no problem,and got it where it needed to go. Rates were very reasonable.",0
"Excellent services provided, quick and efficient! Excellent prices, takes care of the customer and follows up after everything has been taken care of. Daut is a real go getter!! Thanks man.",0
"Great service, fast, and polite employees.",0
Fast Friendly Professional 5/5,0
Took a lil while but they delivered. Appreciated the help and advice from the driver regards to my vehicles problems.,0
"Best of the Best, Does a great job every time I've used them.",0
Best 24/7 towing company in Alaska. Price was affordable and we didn't wait very long. The driver was able to give us a ride to where we needed to go.,0
Very friendly. When I called he told me where he was and gave me an eta. As soon as he arrived he talked me through the process and offered recommendations. Comforting in a stressful situation. Thank you again,0
"Good communication, fast service, good price",0
"The personal I worked with was Steven and when I called to explain my situation he asked great questions I didnâ€™t think to ask. For example, can it go into neutral, is it front wheel or rear wheel, do you have access to the key? He was super friendly, has great problem solving skills, is reasonable, 24 hour service, and definitely knows what he is doing. He treated my baby Volksie with care as if it was one of his cars. I recommend this tow company to anyone.",0
"Driver arrived within a reasonable time, service was great, would recommend to a friend/family.",0
"My friend needed his vehicle towed at 11 PM at night. The driver arrived 10 minutes after we called. Within three or four minutes his vehicle is loaded and we were already warm inside the vehicle heading to drop off the car. Excellent customer service, very friendly driver, very fast as well. Anything you need don't hesitate to call them. Forget overpriced Vulcan towing, Forget Riggs towing who constantly up charges, nevermind Aurora and they're pissed poor customer service. Eagle towing will always be my first call.",0
"Everything you need for your tow truck at an affordable price is found at Eagle Towing Anchorage! Fast, Friendly Service At Eagle Towing",0
"Super pleasant, unlike the others i called he was ready to head out immediately, really affordable price too, highly recommend",0
"Specifically asked for them to be here at 7, so that I can drop truck off at a shop before my work shift starts at 8. No show, no call. Edit: Yeah, I hung up the phone on you after your pathetic excuses and called a real towing company that showed up in minutes.",0
Very friendly and professional Towing at an affordable price just want to say that you are awesome thank you so much,0
"I prefer this store over all other locations in Anchorage. Employees are always nice, knowledgeable, and efficient.",0
Rude and poor service,0
"UPS was unable to accept my package with the return label provided by Amazon, but the cashier was quick to explain why and offer what assistance she could.",0
Walked in at 1030am with about 250lbs of stuff and Kendra took care of me perfectly. Very easy to work with and great at her job. Definitely felt like a valued customer.,0
I went in to send my textbooks back today and the woman behind the counter was so helpful! She helped me package up my books and taped everything up for me. Awesome service.,0
"Prompt, attentive service on most visits. Convenient location.",0
"9/08/2016 The native woman behind the counter was rude, annoying, and never said ""hello"", never greeted me or ever once smiled. Never once let me know what she was doing, to keep me informed. Is this the kind of service we can expect from UPS????",0
"One cashier helping customers, the other cashier was on the phone, then left the cash register in spite of tg he long line. I ended up leaving.",0
"Last year, I received terrible service here, but today it was great. Fast and easy.",0
"For starters, I couldn't figure out how to get to the drive thru for the longest! And the wait to use it, well, is too slow for convenient. Location of the bank and customer service is great! Wait times inside and out- not so great.",0
They need to change their hours. The lobby is closed on Saturday now. The ATM is also out of order.,0
"Always long lines and nobody working. The worst bank you can have. They are slow, lazy and understaffed.",0
"No greeters, only 1 worker in member services, and long lines/wait time at 3 on a monday...",0
This is litterally the worst credit union in town staff make up fake policies because they are too lazy to want to do their job every time we go here we have a problem then we go to a different and lookie there no problems,0
Was in for airplane payoff and transfer all went perfect for us,0
It's a very good bank.,0
Parking lot is small but free!,0
This is my church of choice i drive across town twice a week to worship here,0
"Friendly faces, warm smiles, and you can feel the love the second you walk in the doors!",0
Amazing church and amazing people I been going here for almost 4 years and I love it. Very dedicated people.,0
Great sermon. Simply a pleasure,0
I went there with my son every Monday night for cub scouts. The fact that they let us use one of there classrooms every Monday is so awesome!,0
Great place to worship.,0
Been through some reorganizations internally over the last year or so. Head pastor changed out which is hard for many but the new on is fantastic.,0
"A great church building , alot of programs and several different services.",0
My home Church. Love you guy's.,0
I love going there everytime I hear something just for me.,0
Again... The name says it all,0
"I had an autostart installed by Will. I had a groupon for $169. Dropped the car off at 9:30AM and picked up at 3:00PM. Very prompt, professional service. Works beautifully. I highly Recommend Sublime Designz.",0
"They offer leasing option, but I will go through another place on my own to get tires on rims, they over price getting tires on rims they go through another tire shop anyways. And charge way more.",0
He couldn't put a remote start in my car so I got reimbursed from Groupon. He was very nice and helpful.,0
"Will does excellent work.. Period... Those reviews say nothing about his installs they are obviously fake and have other motives other than a review.. I've flagged those reviews. Think About it. Blank reviews?.. Will has installed many autostarts for me, and done audio work for me and installed headrest monitors for me worked on my drift car. I'll be glad to post pictures of his work. ZERO problems, and always done professionally. My double DIN conversions look great on my trucks.. He also goes the extra mile, many shops are ok with crimp connections or taps.. not for Will, he knows that a soldered connection is the best connection.. I invite people to watch him work he is methodical and careful, a real craftsman in my opinion.",0
Had an Auto starter put in. Great Service! Timely. I will tell my friends about him.,0
Will is the GREATEST. my new remote start..,0
I had Will put in a Idata start in my sons Subaru and he did a great job. Will takes his time and makes sure everything is installed and wired correctly.,0
don't listen to the whiny female's post above maybe she is a piece of trash - she obviously name calls like a 5 year old,0
"This was my first residence after high school. I lived on the third floor and found that most nights the noise from the hall (and other apartments) can keep one up in the night. The parking is not plowed in the winter! Only the sidewalks... This is burdensome during a heavy winter... The appliance are exactly the same as that when my cousin lived there in the early 2000s - and they don't work consistently. Laundry facilities are in the center of each building, which I did not use due to mistreatment and the lack of a cleaning effort. Which are also the same case for the halls and stairs, which constantly have spills for days unless you clean it yourself even after reporting it. The only thing I liked about the area is the pretty yard between all the buildings, with the nice trees and flowers.",0
Nice apartments and landscape,0
"I agree the office staff is rather rude. They look like coffee baristas that have NO social skills. I'd rather take my money and business over to Sophies... Staff at Sophies is super helpful and kind, the grounds are cleaner where as at Jillian there's cigarette butts everywhere, trash everywhere, Sophies is quiet, comfortable, professional, and I feel much safer there. If you have a choice of renting from Jillian vs Sophies, choose Sophie Plaza! I hope this helps someone...",0
Standard type of apartments... Lots of noise from all sides as usual.,0
Nice clean resort.,2
"Very helpful staff, in and out speedy service...",0
These employees make the college rd location excellent.,0
Helpful and friendly staff. They had my truck running when I got there and swept it out before I left.,0
"They helped me to get my uhal u box rental that I had shipped from Vancouver Wa to Fairbanks Ak set up on their trailer. But they charged me an extra month for the u box , I agreed to pay with the understanding that I would get a refund for the remaining 25 days of the one month rental....the online uhaul will not give me a refund for the 25 days left that I turned In the ubox on the trailer!ðŸ˜¤ I am only giving them a 3 â­ because my stuff arrived in perfect shape and nothing broken. That is thanks to my sister packing it very well. Uhaul on Airport way should be giving me a refund for 25 days!ðŸ˜¤",0
"I have had no problems at all at this location, compared to other locations. Super helpful, quick, and always open on time. Highly recommend this location.",0
Prices and services are great. Nice having a second store for trailer rental. Moving my work tool box has been easy with the low ramp trailer.,0
Only return location for my review. Two folks working at the time. Very polite. Reasonably knowledgeable. Plenty of supplies in stock. Clean restrooms.,0
Check out their towing section. Great prices for a lot of really useful stuff,0
Took them almost an hour just to give me the keys to one of their vans,0
I work here.,2
Best staff in town,0
Best Pho and Vermicelli noodles with pork. Such a great place for a small and relatively remote place.,0
Love the food!!,2
Regular mom and pop type restaurant. Good food. Nothing extravagant.,0
"The name Fast Food is a misnomer. The food does arrive in a reasonable amount of time, but unlike fast food, the quality is very good.",0
Decent American-style Chinese food for somewhere in the middle of the Bering Sea/North Pacific. Big portions and prices were surprisingly comparable to Anchorage or Seattle.,0
Large portions and the only restaurant on this side of the island.,0
The manager takes pride in this place. It shows in the way he treats people. My wife had a positive experience. I had my own a few days later. Excellent customer service.,0
One of the best Uhauls I have used to move all over N America,0
Quick and efficient. Trailers were in good shape.,0
Good prices and a good facility. The only reason for the poor review is that they close acess to your belongings at 7pm. That's ridiculous. Can't access your own belongings. If you work in the evening. If they ever have more reasonable hours i'll leave a better review,0
Nice property didn't have what I was looking for. Looked like they had everything else.,0
Great friendly staff,2
Great place to get boxes and moving supplies.,0
They had a trailer we needed to borrow. It worked out.,0
"They just moved into the old Fred Meyer's building, so it's a bit messy, but the owner/mgr (not sure) Chris was super friendly and funny. I would definitely go back to him. They had my truck ready to go.",0
Great staff very helpful,0
Always good service!,2
Good friendly service,2
Never has trailers,2
What an amazing business! I needed to rent a storage unit short term for an upcoming move. Yana S. helped me through the entire process over the phone and it went smoothly. Later that evening I took things to the unit and really saw the extent of the great customer service. She picked the unit that would meet my needs and had the new lock and keys ready. There was even a bottle of water set out for us. My wife was exceptionally pleased with the cleanliness of the units and the entire property. Really appreciate the wonderful service!,0
Polite people and a safe place to store our stuff.,0
"Have been using them for over 5 Years. Very secure storage at affordable price. Gate with digital code, cctv cameras, always well maintained during winter, friendly staff and care about their customers. Would like to see dumpster come back into facility maybe",0
Safe and secure storage. Plenty of cctv cameras to ensure security of the storage area. Front gate requires digital code to gain entry.,0
They are suppose to bill one month after you set up storage they don't and they don't tell you this so you get a late fee if your funds aren't there for the whenever they decide to bill you date.,0
"Super pricey, narrow hallways",0
Had to switch from a midwife to an OB at 36 weeks. Transferring wasn't smooth but everything else is great. The doctor is super caring and is working hard to honor as much of my birth plan as possible. The office is super professional and has a great set up.,0
"I love everything about the office. From the customer service to the waiting room, to the person that draws your blood. Would recommend without hesitation.",0
"After having a recent terrible experience with another Gyno office it was so so wonderful to find Dr. Suprinkna at Denali Ob-Gyn Clinic. The whole experience from the first phone call as the staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and patient to the final out come of my procedure was smooth, pleasant and professional. Dr Suprinkna and the staff restored my faith that there really is honestly good professionals local right here in Anchorage. Highly recommended!",0
"Iâ€™ve been seeing Dr. Saprykina for nearly two decades and I am truly lucky to have her as a physician. She has seen me through several health issues and I credit her for saving my life when I had a complication with my pregnancy. She is kind, warm, genuine ... and confidently brilliant (without being condescending at all). Visits never feel rushed and no question is ever too elementary. Dr. Saprykina is a person who has followed her calling, you can immediately tell she is passionate about her work, her patients and all of the babies she brings into the world. Iâ€™d recommend her as an OB or GYN, she will take excellent care of any woman no matter your stage in life.",0
Very peaceful place! Staff are nice!,0
Everyone is always very friendly and helpful!,0
"Dr. Saprykina is by far the best! I received the best care with her. She made me so comfortable, I think I am ready for baby #2!",0
Very knowledgeable and caring staff. I refered my sister here because I know they will take care of her like they take care of me.,0
Clean and a modern facility! Dr. Vance spent her time answering questions and making me feel comfortable. If you are looking for a new provider or your first ever visit this is the place to go.,0
Staff is always extremely friendly but I wish they would minimize the amount of people they allow in their lobby. Especially right now during this pandemic,0
"Felt valued and cared for, the Doctor took time to speak with me not rush me through.",0
"Dr. Korneeva is absolutely the most professional, competent, knowledgeable, compassionate, and gentle OB. I give my highest recommendation.",0
Dr Elam and staff are absolutely amazing. I was seen quickly and was able to get all of my needs met. I highly recommend for all your womanly needs!!,0
"Everyone at the clinic was so compassionate, enthusiastic, and friendly. From the front desk staff, to the CMA, to Dr. Saprykina, to the adorable phlebotomist. They were all very knowledgeable and really made me feel at ease as a nervous patient. Everyone took the time to answer all my questions and didn't make me feel rushed at all. I couldn't believe how kind each person I interactd with was. I highly recommend Denali Ob-Gyn.",0
This is a friendly office with caring and attentive doctors and staff.,0
Dr. S IS AWESOME!,0
Anthony with Heat Source Mechanical did a great job for us and would recommend him to anyone! He went above and beyond to assist with answering questions that we had. Great service!!,0
"I called and got an appointment the next day, for a PM for our furnace. Jesse was early, which was great, and very polite and professional, and already was wearing a mask. He was done in about an hour and a half and it cost $348 for the PM. I would definitely recommend HeatSource and Jesse! They even sent a text to track the tech so you could see when they would arrive, and each technician has a star rating. Thank you, Jesse!!",0
Great customer service!,2
So far so good. Had an initial diagnostic. Tech showed me the hole I. The bottom of the heat exchanger. Now for an estimate and repairs for the final review. To be Continued...,0
"Our boiler quit working over night. After several phone calls around town I found HeatSource. They not only had the single most cheerful lady (Christie I think her name was), she was the most helpful. Able to immediately give me both a time and cost estimate for the check to see what the problem was. The repair guy was at my house right when they said they would be and was able to figure out my boiler's issue right away. Very helpful, I would recommend them to anyone in their service area.",0
"Gene was very friendly, knowledgeable and answered all our questions. He told us what was wrong with our boiler and gave us some options of what we should do. He was very courteous and is an asset to the company! Thank you!",0
"Fast friendly service, even put little booties on to spare the carpet. Cost is high but they do excellent work. Dennis was great and explained the problem well. He gave us our options in a clear manner and did not just suggest the most expensive solution.",0
Very professional services and great price!,0
"Terrible at communicating. I called multiple times to check the status of a part they ""ordered"". Come to find they had never ordered the part. Charged me hundreds of dollars and were not able to figure out the problem. Had to call another mechanic.",0
Fast Response. Friendly and knowledgeable professionals! I'm glad I called them ! =),0
Very professional courteous and quick to respond. Would highly recommend,0
I have had excellent experience with heat source they have done all repairs in an quick and well trained manner I will keep using them.,0
Very dishonest owner. Did not follow through with agreement. Use a different business.,0
Jessica Johnson is amazing. I used to suffer from chronic headaches but after a couple of sessions working my back and neck it's a rarity.,0
"Very quiet, very clean and the staff is extremely polite. Beautiful building inside and out.",0
Great staff and are always able to get me in on short notice!,0
The place is filled with smiles and friendly faces that make your massages even better,0
"What a wonderful place for massage, great front of the house staff and I have had the experience of teaching the massage staff and am continuesly surprised at how well the establishment cares for heir employees. The massage therapists of Alaska Massage Clinic are grade AA",0
Thee best place to get a massage,0
So accommodating and talented. See Victoria for wonderful results.,0
"Love, love, love this place! Friendly staff, great masseuses and chiropractor!",0
Really great customer service and always able to get in pretty quickly.,0
Always nice here. I recommend deep tissue massage by their specialist.,0
Really comfortable environment,2
Great services and they take insurance.,0
Nice hike and the dogs enjoyed it so much. Good for beginners like myself,0
Mountain bike trails rip. Beautifully built rock features and some nice jumps,0
Fun trail to hike. Plenty of people cross country skiing as well.,0
Great recreation area. The trails are groomed well in the winter and well maintained in the spring-summer. A great place to spend outdoor time with the kids.,0
Nice mowed trails in the Matsu for a leisurely walk.,0
nice place. mountain bike trail,0
"Beautiful, well maintained, great trails!",0
Sadly not boarded but nice trail good veiws,0
Love these trails.,2
Great hiking trails,2
"The shop is wonderful to visit, first you are greeted with beautiful gems sparkling everywhere, and then you meet with Larry who was extremely helpful and full of information. I believe that a good product will sell itself, and this is definitely the impression I am left with here. Not to mention they manufacture campers right here in Alaska. What not to love!",0
They were great at helping me find the right part.,0
Very nice and friendly service. Very polite on the phone and has a good amount of information to help newbees with their RV needs.,0
"One of my MH cargo doors had developed a delamination. Larry thought he could fix it, saving me lots of money over a replacement door. Unfortunately, the door could not be repaired. But that's not why I rate this shop so highly. Larry refused to accept payment for his time and effort to fix the door; rather, he apologized for not being able to fix it. What a refreshing experience - integrity and honesty. This is my first experience with this shop, but I will be a returning customer. Thanks, again Larry for your efforts.",0
"Great service, good prices, knowledgeable.",0
Great little local shop for RV parts or repair. Every time Iâ€™ve been in there they have been friendly and helpful in finding or ordering what I need. They are a small shop so plan in advance so you donâ€™t waste your time or theirs for that matter. Good folks to do business with. Bought my new awning from them last week.,0
The workers at cashe camper are very customer service oriented. Even though they were unable to find the part I needed they gave me suggestion where I might be able to locate one piece that I needed. I will return to buy parts that I need for my RV from them in the future.,0
"I've been doing business with the folks at Cache Camper for 10 years. It is always a pleasurable learning experience when I go in for information and parts. Whe I leave I always have the exact parts needed for my project. I have also used them for all of my repairs on my RV. Their workmanship is always beyond my expectations. They do a very professional job in all work they do. The staff is professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. Thankyou all.",0
"As always, a good place to see about Alaskan-based company for canopy, camper and RV needs.",0
Offered many customization options but prices for a simple barebones cab over camper shell start at 7000$. Way too pricy for cheap diyers but damn cheap compated to 70000 artic foxes etc et al. If your only there for lifts for diy camper shells be warned tbey start at 300$ per lift leg.,0
They always have what we need in stock. The office gals are super nice and the owner always greets people when he is in the office.,0
"Most places in Alaska when asked for an expedited install, don't care or aren't willing. Cach Camper had my rig in shop and installed with a new AC unit and canopy within weeks not months. Both my AC and canopy we're special ordered even. My parents had thier camper done up with items already in stock and were done done I days.",0
"* * * * * 5 * * * * * Cache Camper Manufacturing. Prepare to be impressed! If you're looking for a Specialized, Skillfully Made, Custom Camper, Canopy, Iditarod Kennel on Wheels or Your Own Custom Design,... you've come to the right place! You'd think Larry has been building campers since before dinosaurs existed! His vast wealth of knowledge and almost 40 years in the custom manufacturing business will not go unnoticed. Larry is very helpful and does his best to serve and meet everyone's needs, even to the point of exhaustion! He is VERY customer service minded. He and his very knowledgeable staff will do their best to answer any questions, assess damages and give estimates, to meeting your individual RV product needs from a vast inventory of over 10000 parts! New and Older styles alike! Let's start with the ladies in the office... Jennifer is amazing and irreplaceable. She knows more about parts than I think even the manufacturers do! She is at the heart of all things Cache Camper. Receiving, sending, ordering, answering, selling, scheduling,.... if you've got questions, she's got the answer or she'll know where to go in the shop to find the answer OR the product! She's AMAZING! Ramona is wonderful in assisting in whatever way she can if Jennifer is unavailable. Jennifer is teaching her all that she can. Ramona has got her hands full! Now the Shop and crew.... Vitaliy and his crew are a talented, remodeling / repair force that truly know their business! David is an incredibly talented young man that has a vast skill set for his age, and he's passing that knowledge and mindset on to his young protege Joshua. Dave takes the project given, whether Camper, Canopy, Auto mod, RV weatherizing, or any slew of modifications and/or upgrades and he does them with 5 star fashion with attention to detail! ... and then there's Norm! Norm is a Camper and Canopy building NINJA! This guy is an Artisan when it comes to Campers and Canopies alike. Building to phenomenal, cabinet grade standards and quality! Norm takes RV manufacturing to a whole new level, which in turn brings to market one of the tightest, best built, custom Campers one could dream of owning. So if you're in the market to buy Alaskan, and you want quality and home town service, you need to give Larry and his staff the opportunity to show you what they can do,... whether you decide on your own existing or custom being insulated, bonded, specialized, customized, or decide on one of Cache Camper's many designs, you won't be disappointed. Prepare to be impressed. Just give them enough lead time to build your dream, so that when you're ready to enjoy all that Alaska has to offer, you'll be ready to do it with peace of mind. ... This is my unbiased opinion, coming from 25 plus years as a Journeyman Carpenter / jack of all trades of fine commercial construction all along the west coast. Sincerely! Shawn Monroe ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ˜Š",0
"Super fast, very friendly, fixed what we had broken quickly and without breaking the wallet. We'll definitely be back and highly recommend them to anyone!",0
They do great work really great people would go there again,0
Had the parts we needed. Very helpful.,0
Great place to get your RV fixed and services,0
They are not very nice or helpful.,0
"If you need that hard to find part for your travel trailer or RV, this is your local source. Check with them before ordering online. You may save time and ðŸ’°",0
This complex is a nice place. .please follow all the rules and respect other people as you want to be respected... The management is kind the rent is average for the area and units are comfortable.,0

"My 1st time here, they came HIGHLY recommened an i see why! My experience was absolutely top of the line! I got my brazilian wax, a derma facial, and a back treatment. My skin feels AMAZING! Definitely will be back to see Hunter, she was an absolute doll! Felt like I was talking to one of my girlfriends lol thanks boo!",0
They are awesome and fast as hell,0
"This is THE BEST PLACE to go for all you spa needs, wants, and self care. I ALWAYS recommend them for all self care services. knowledgeable friendly and attentive",0
"I love this place- Catelyn is excellent at what she does! Iâ€™ve been going here for waxing for 6 months and enjoy this place- their prices are competitive, everything is clean, and they make you feel very comfortable during your experience. One time, there was some hair missed during my wax, and I called about it the following day and they fixed it right away!",0
Customer service is impeccable. The quality of the services provided to me where beyond my expectation. The owner is kind and full of laughter. I left there feeling way better than I did when I got there.,0
"I've been going here for a couple years now. Best Brazilian in Anchorage hands down. I usually see Hannah, but I think all of the estheticians are great. They are friendly, punctual, and efficient. I am usually in and out in just over 20 minutes.",0
I loved this place. She did my hair amazingly and they honored my Groupon price. A little pricey but they do a great job!,0
"Great services, inexpensive pricing. Very personable. Love Catelyn and how friendly she is to people. Very caring and always smiling. Never felt uncomfortable!",0
"Best place in town for lash extensions. High quality, long lasting and affordable. Great staff.",0
Love going here I am never surprised. Consistent great quality wax.,0
Amazing staff incredible quality of service,0
"They have great prices and the atmosphere is very nice. However, between the lack of customer service and quality of work I will never be going back there again.",0
Great place to get your spa day at . The ladies are Great,0
"When the newer harbor was built the whole place felt like it got an upgrade. Boat launch is wide and easy to use, and there's always lots of parking. Fishing out of this port is a blast.",0
"The Valdez Commercial Boat Harbor is a great addition to Valdez. Larger ships can sometimes dock here, so keep your eyes open and cameras ready! If this review was helpful please click the Like button.",0
"Clean,safe well maintained",2
Busy and they just about have everything your looking for when it comes to fishing and its accessories. Beautiful on any day no matter the weather. Friendly town people. Clean streets and alleys and even the police are top notch. Well only u can reverse that comment,0
Nice but Temps in the shower rooms is to low to be comfortable for winter.,0
"The place is super fancy and should be for as much as the city spent on its construction. Staff are helpful, AJ is the boss and he will take care of anything you need.",0
There's service and alcohol here.,0
"I'm all about supporting local businesses but these people are so shady that I wouldn't waste another penny at their business. They seem money hungry for asking to charge me $150 for ""diagnostic testing"" when the problem with my truck was simply a flasher that needed replacing. Not to mention I had my multi function switch replaced by them and it does not work right since being replaced. It takes about 5 seconds for my windshield wipers to work and it gets stuck when using the blinkers. I pulled my truck out of the shop and took it to another local auto body shop which is what I should have done in the first place.... my mistake.",0
first time I needed a look at everything on the suv and they did a great job and put it into differant quotes so I could do the most nessesary first. Great job,0
"I had a problem with a rear caliper intermittently locking up. They recommended that they replace all of my rear braking equipment at a cost of over $1200. Perhaps you too would find this recommendation very suspicious if 13 months before you had done just that very thing and had not skimped on the quality of the parts. They tried to manipulate my wife and their diagnosis was at the very least incompetent; (I personally favor a different word that speaks to lacking integrity). I state this because when I changed the lone caliper that was malfunctioning the problem went away. Their only redeeming quality that I gave them 1 point for was that they have a van that they use to drop people off when they drop off their vehicle. Though I will never have need of that service, due to their lack of competency or honesty depending on how you want to interpret their 400% markup on a simple caliper replacement job. It took an hour and a half to complete at a cost of a whopping $120; the irony of that price still sticks in my craw! I find their recommendations to be highly suspect and likely dishonest. There is absolutely no reason I would ever utilize their services again!",0
Good fair work,2
Do not trust,2
"BUYER BEWARE FRAUD HERE! this company is fraudulent in it's practices. I called them up and ordered Spyder Halo LED Projector headlights for my 1500 dodge ram. I confirmed and reconfirmed that the headlights were Spyder Led headlights; the man said yes they are the spider halo projector LED headlights repeating the brand and style to me. I excitedly made my appointment to get them installed. When I picked my truck the man says to me he could upgrade the bulbs to LED for $400. I was under the impression I was already purchasing LED headlights; because that's what I was quoted for when I called and because the guy assured me repeatedly, that they were the Spyder Halo Projector LED lights requested. Then when I looked at the headlights they were not Spyder Halo LED headlights they are an off brand and they were not LED; instead he installed OEM Halogen aftermarket headlights; Not even close to the brand or style I had ordered and been sold. To make things worse they were not even LED they are halogen lights. He never mentioned anything outside of being able to get exactly what I was asking him for. When I picked up my truck I noticed right away my rain guard had been damaged. The man argued with me saying we could look at the camera. I asked him to yes please lets review the camera; I am confident 100% with out any doubt; I know, my rain guard was not damaged when I brought the truck in so yes please lets review the camera. The man says that's ok' we don't need to waist time looking at the camera, I'll just replace it. I have called several times and the company has done nothing to fix or resolve my issues in any way shape or form. They are telling me that Chris is who I need to speak with; Chris has not been available when I call in and had not returned any of my calls. Again this company will sell you a specific part and install a part not even close to what was clearly sold to the customer; to me that is fraud; and that is why the buyer beware. They lie cheat and break things with no regard to the customer and manage their business with no sense of responsibility. Update 5/29; these headlights were installed 4/27 and the running light in the passenger side headlight is already not working. So even the work they did do was not very reliable or long lasting.",0
"I purchased a truck with a random auto start already installed. It worked fine for a few months then quit unexpectedly. So i called around to various shops. Most would not even look at it. But Quentin here at Extreme Auto, he offered to help me out. He fixed it in under 5 min. and did not charge me at all. With this great customer service for not even being an actual customer, i give 5 stars. Thanks again guys.!",0
"These people are awesome. I've gotten 3 auto starts installed on 3 separate vehicles and its always affordable, and always done well.",0
"Awesome customer service over the phone. Unfortunately that's where it ends. - I had to pay over the phone in full ($605) for an appointment on their books. - Appointment was made for autostart install, tire switchover, and alignment. - I showed up for my 9am Tuesday drop-off appointment and was told they moved my appointment to Thursday. They stated they had the wrong phone number for me which is why I didn't know. - They said they'd do the tire switchover and alignment but couldn't do the remote start unless I wanted to switch appointment days. I chose to forgo the autostart and just get the tires switched and alignment. - I called Extreme Auto at 5:45pm because I had yet to hear back from them letting me know my truck was ready. They stated they weren't actually able to get to my truck today because they were too busy. - Never got an apology for any of their lack of communication. - I asked for a refund and said I'll take my business elsewhere. They said they don't know how to refund my money. BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE.",0
had an extra 75 charge fee for service to put on the autostart Service fee for what something I already bought.,0
"Great Service, knowledgeable staff. Price/value is good!",0
The staff is knowledgeable and helpful with those that may be a little lost in the world of auto customization. I find Joe to be exceptional and the services offered range from tires to lofts to lights to auto starts.,0
Upgraded to the one mile radius for free!,0
Place seemed to have everything and if they didn't they could get it in less than a week.,0
Good of take care of me,0
Great customer service.,2
Had a Colonoscopy May 2021. Dr. Gulley and Staff were Awesome. Had not worries and everything was handle with Professionalism and with Excellent Customer Satisfaction.,0
"My wife had surgery and Dr. Gulley and the whole staff at their office and the doctor at the hospital were absolutely first class. It is a crazy thing and may be something in our water but I have the same growth as my wife and the Doctor is monitoring it but I would be honored if it needs to come out down the road to have Dr. Gulley remove that for me. I think I will wait until Corona is over so my wife can visit me, ha.",0
Happy that I decided to go to Glacier Surgical and Dr Shannon Gulley. They are a great team ~ I highly recommend you to choose them too you'll benefit from a very professional warm and organized staff and physicians!,0
Dr. Gulley is an excellent surgeon and so reassuring to work with. She really explains every step of the procedure and patiently answers any questions. Dr. Gulley made a stressful situation much easier and I'd gladly work with her again if the need arises.,0
"Great first visit! Dr. Gulley and her staff explained the procedure, my options, and the risks. I am very happy with how we are proceeding.",0
Great experience. Thank you!,0
it was a informative and very friendly visit,0
Great staff with top not quality service. I highly recommend this place for buying an new atv or side by side. They run great specials on new machines. Only problem I had was that after market parts seemed a bit pricey. Service was impeccable and I enjoyed my buying experience I didn't feel overwhelmed or pressured to buy.,0
Great place. Have many parts for old sleds and new alike. Owner is very personal and cares.,0
Great customer service and a good variety of vehicles on display.,0
Employees are helpful and had hard it find parts.,0
Awesome service and had answers I needed,0
"There are some beautiful machines in here, love it",0
"Best small engine shop in town. Very friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. Whether I have them do the work or they get me the right part to do it myself, I can always count on them to get me back on the throttle. Thanks to ALL the staff there!",0
Knowledgeable staff and friendly service.,0
Friendly and well knowledgeable company.,0
"These guys are top notch for any 4Ã—Wheeler, motorcycle,side by side, any ATV, snow machine. Second to no one, price, workmanship, time faster their top notch!",0
Darby always has been super helpful and they continue to amaze,0
Good people good service,0
"Went to Fun Center a few times for the same issue, they told me they rode my bike and it was fine. It wasn't. I was told Fun Center was the only place that would work on Kawasaki motorcycles, but Darby's was happy to take my bike in. It took them one day to identify and replace the damaged chain. Even better, they treated me like a person. They listened and were not rude about anything. Thank you guys for everything -- I REALLY appreciate it!",0
"Sarah behind the counter is rather knowledgeable and always helpful, Mike and Chris are great mechanics and honest people",0
Great place to get parts or have your stuff worked on,0
Always very helpful. I've also known several who have had their machines worked on here and have heard absolutely no complaints whatsoever about anything.,0
The work was perfect and they were able to get parts no one else could.,0
Excellent service and knowledgeable staff!,0
Great service and great staff,0

"My son had his first appointment at Northern smiles today. They exceeded my expectations, I wish I could name all the wonderful lady's that helped my son feel comfortable today. He can't wait for his next appointment just so he can see everyone again. Thank you for going above and beyond to welcoming, kind, and caring. If I could give more stars I would.",0
"In the last two years, I haven't seen a better staff and orthodontist ever. I have an amazing smile where before it caused me a lot of pain. They are incredibly caring and are genuine about taking your needs and wants seriously. I wouldn't go anywhere else if I needed any other work done and I wouldn't refer anyone to any place else.",0
The staff is very friendly and the Dr. is awesome.,0
"Great place, friendly staff ðŸ‘",0
"What an incredible office!! Love the entire staff and team, and Dr Johnson is the best! The entire team is so well-trained, and I really appreciate that... they are all on the same page. Love coming here!",0
They have good staff and a pleasant office. We had a good experience and appreciated all they did.,0
Dr. Johnson and his staff are just great. They have provided my son with such an amazing smile. There's not enough nice words to say how awesome this office is. They're like family because that's how they treat you. Payment plans for those who can't afford the whole payment upfront. I recommend it. If having a great smile is what you want then make an appointment as soon as you can.,0
"The BEST OF THE BEST! I just can't give them enough praise. Their customer service is impeccable, their pricing can't be beat, and their payment plans are SUPER flexible. I started my orthodontic journey with Northern Smiles back in 2014, I started with Invisalign, I didn't like it so we switched to traditional braces, no hassle, no problem, NO EXTRA COST. At one point I had some financial difficulties, and they actually gave me back a portion of a payment to help me out. Name any other Orthodontic office that would do that..... I will be bringing my children to this office and anyone else I can persuade. You can not go wrong with Northern Smiles! Thank you Dr. Johnson, Narda, and everyone else that has helped make this journey great!",0
"High quality services, great and professional staff, pleasant interactions. Highly recommend this place.",0
"Upon walking thru the door, the ladies at the front desk acknowledged our arrival with warm greetings and genuine smiles. The waiting area is small, but the sitting arrangement and placement is accommodating and comfortable, with juice boxes and waters in a lil mini fridge for patients and guests. The rest of the staff were a perfect mix of ""bouncy, bright"" (my 7 year old's description) and ""nice and cool"" (my 9 years old's opinion) ladies, whom -in my opinion- are exceptionally down-to-earth and friendly! The orthodontist was just as cool and collected. My girls (ages mentioned before) actually felt included in their consultation, and ""at-home"". For our first time visit, we enjoyed ourselves and look forward to visits to come!",0
"Had a great experience test driving several used cars to find the right fit for my family and ultimately purchased one the next day. No-pressure, friendly, honest and reasonable salespeople. Jennie Evers took care of me and made the process as easy as possible. Highly recommended if youâ€™re in the market for a reliable vehicle.",0
I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a vehicle to purchase the guys working there are very nice and work with you in anyway they possibly can,0
"Clyde and Jay were very helpful in the car buying process. They weren't overbearing or pressuring at all, they answered all my questions and made the whole process so much smoother. If you are looking to get a quality vehicle at a fair price without feeling pressured this is the place to go!",0
"Even though I just did a few test drives on two vehicles clyde is an awesome salesman. Hes non pushy and he wants to make the customer happy also, will work with you to make it possible for the customer. When the timing is right for me for a purchase i will go back to him. Thank you for a fantastic, non stress visit.",0
Extremely friendly and high quality of service. They have a lot of options and even if there is something you are looking for its not on the lot they make sure they help you and find it. Highly recommended â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†,0
"I rented a premium SUV and was upgraded to the next level when they didn't have one. It was great! The vehicle was awesome, and the staff was very nice. I had the SUV for two weeks and returned it. There was no hidden fees and all the details were up front. I will definitely go back to National car rental again.",0
They were amazing. Budget screwed me over on a car I prepaid for and National swooped in and saved the day for $23. I couldn't have asked for anything better. Thank you for saving my birthday!,0
Great options for cars in the executive area.,0
"As Emerald Executive Elite members, it was my worst experience! Besides I got a dirty vehicle, I wasn't allowed to change vehicle because they ""locked the keys"" an hour before closing. They won't pre-arrange to change vehicle because I have to call first the next morning. I'm already in front of the counter and they can't do that for me. Terrible and worst rental service I have ever experienced with National.",0
Friendly and very helpful staff!,0
Great customer service!,2
Quick and very courteous,0
Cool small park that is basically a baseball field!,0
"It's was a good place for the kids. But lately, their has been some shady characters.",0
Doggy and I love it,0
Its primarily a baseball park.,0
I'm sure it's amazing when the smoke and haze clears up. ðŸ¤·â™‚ï¸,0
Great hiking trails. Nature at its best.,0
"Great point to see the city at anytime, night day or snow. Also great place to see the Aurora.",0
"Nice hiking, great views.",0
Quickly being ruined by California Instagrammers and Chinese foreigners with absolutely no situational awareness and common courtesy for other people in the area. TURN OFF YOU F@(#$ CAR LIGHTS AND FLASHLIGHTS!,0
Great easy access hiking area,0
"Beuatiful,be ready to walk and bring big spray!",0
Great fun for the whole family.,0
Lots of fun climbing on the rocks.,0
Always recieved excellent service and style whenever I was able to get in. Love this studio,0
"Wonderful salon! Maiâ€™s skills are unparalleled. Doesnâ€™t matter what youâ€™re looking for, she and her team of stylists will take care of you. Canâ€™t recommend Studio MOD enough!",0
"Very friendly, clean and welcoming. Mai is very skilled and talented. Takes the time to understand what her customers want and help them to achieve the look they are wanting.",0
Very clean and amazing staff.,0
"I absolutely love Christine! She's professional, prompt, and gentle. She doesn't waste your time... in and out and everything is done right.",0
"Great Service + Beautiful Space I have worked with a couple of the independent technicians for various services and I am always impressed. From hair care, eyelashes, and even tattooing, this salon offers it all. I like that each technician/artist, is responsible for themselves, as it makes it easier for communicating and remember my specific needs/desires. I also feel like this helps an individual create a better relationship with their technician so you can walk away happy and understood.",0
Studio MOD is a beautiful Salon. Alisha does excellent hairstyles and I love getting highlights. She takes her time and does an excellent job.,0
"Mai Kacillas, owner, and Kirstin Forbes are the best stylists in town. Working with them both for over 4 years on Editorial, Client, & Personal styling; I send all my friends and family to Studio Mod. Best to book in advance, but completely worth the wait!",0
"Super trendy, they have done wonders to my friends hair. Looking forward to getting my done there next.",0
Kirsten does awesome cuts and awesome color ay the hair salon and Cassie does awesome brows microblading in the salon below and there's even an outstanding tattoo artist named ping,0
Love Sarah. She is a wonderful colorist.,0
"I guess they did not need my money. Walked in to schedule appointment. Girls busy talking in back stall, they saw me. No acknowledgement after 10 min waiting.",0
Mai is hands down the best stylist in town.,0
Great customer service,2
"This store is so unique! They have everything you can think of here to wow your friends. You can grab a precious baby shower gift, luxurious soaps and lotions, gorgeous aprons and tea towels. There's so much more! They have stationary, cups, tea sets, special Alaskan creations. I got this awesome tea pot there as well as a coffee mug that has a built in hand warmer. Be careful with the hand-warming and bare hands! The cup gets hot. Anyway, this is the place to shop for cool Alaskan treasures outside of the farmer's market and like Wal-Mart. I highly recommend it for even just a stroll through. It will make you happy just walking in there!",0
"Once again, I needed something one of a kind for a specific occasion, and once again they did not let me down! Alaskan made and perfect for what I was looking for!",0
I love this place as if you are looking for a gift or something for yourself you can find things for anyone or age that are unique and special one of a kind items..staff are nice and helpful tho I live very close to this store I've always had a good experience as well as return item if need to. I love this place..they have Seattle pandemonium which I love and Vera Bradley which I collect and love so beware as I started with a scarf.. LoL..you won't be sorry if you go in and find something wonderful..,0
"This is a very-very nice place, in my opinion. They have a lot of cool stuff, like;fountain/dip pens, all sorts of cards, designer bags, decorations, etc. A great place to go for gifts.",0
"This is a gem of Fairbanks. It is more up my wife's alley, but they had such an eclectic collection of artisan notebooks, candles, greeting cards, et cetera -- it was just fun to browse and shop for gifts, especially. We were happy with our purchases and will certainly go back.",0
"You have to stop in, the store has so many cool things, and friendly staff.",0
Love If Only. Always have unique things and great service.,0
"Upscale gift items, gourmet food items.",0
Great unique gifts,2
Nifty eclectic shop,2
My wife and I really believe that this is the best salon in Anchorage!,0
Best place in town for a Mani or Pedi! Excellent customer service and skill...love the atmosphere!,0
It was just what the doctor ordered.i will definetly be back as a consistant regular client.they were the best.,0
"To get in, just call and make an appointment. They were so nice, attentive, and very good. I'm so happy with my new look and my feet, which are a calloused mess all of the time, have never felt softer.",0
Dian and Ann did an amazing job They have new gel nail colors called Cats Eye. Absolutely love it,0
Great service and great peolle!,0
"Tri An gives wonderful pedicures, with relaxing foot and lower leg massages.",0
Always professional and takes the time to do a good job. Love the salon staff!,0
If you want consitant and expert work this is the place to go..Clean and well kept and they are the best at clean and sterlized equipment....,0
"I've been coming here for years, I love the service and I always leave happy.",0
Typical gift shop. Has all of the mass produced souvenirs. Staff was pleasant and store was clean.,0
They sell the same tourist trap junk as 6 other places in glitter gulch. But my Mom was in town so we went...,0
Loved this place for gifts from our trip.,0
Convenient place to purchase souvenirs.,0
Fun place to shop.,0
"The two male employees opening May 30, 2021 were aggressively rude, with no respect for the company or brand they represent. Their lack of any customer service was apparent by the yelling and blatant disrespect of my wife and I when we had simple questions that they should have been able to answer without their disgustingly poor attitude. I've never had an interaction with a customer service person that cared so little about their customers and so easily referenced ""not my job"". One passed us off to the other and the other reluctantly gave us their managers phone number after we asked for it multiple times. Their manager called us to apologize and sent a coupon for a future move but it was a little too late for this location. She said she was new and will be fixing things, hoping for their future customers sake, change happens.",0
The employee tried to charge $253 for a 15 footer. This does not include the mileage you pay afterwards. We were so surprised at this price that we went to a different Uhaul store to get a comparison price. They only charged $60. Don't go here if you like to keep your money.,0
Both this place and the place on Boundary is terrible. Made a reservation with the Old Seward store for the boundary store and somehow they messed it up so I went to the boundary store and they said my reservations at the Old Seward store wasted like 2 hours out of my life,0
Super easy to pick up a vehicle,0
They keep track of their business with you,0
"Do not use this location to install your hitch. I had to spend $400+ to install the hitch and wiring, not including the $300 I paid for the hitch or the receiver. They charged me for 4 hours of labor even though it literally took 1.5 hours to install. Finally, halfway through Canada, the wiring broke due to the fact that they left it dragging on the ground. GO TO SIX ROBLEES. Support local, and they do a better job for an HONEST price.",0
It was quick and easy to rent a uhaul. The staff were friendly. Building was organized. Uhaul was clean. To extend our rental was simple and hassle free. I would recommend them.,0
"The truck they rented out to me had the power steering going out. I could feel there was something weird happening but didn't know what until I got back and they told me what was wrong. Also, the tires were balding really bad and it was still icy and freezing out. Tried contacting customer service and never got a response. Wouldn't recommend renting from them unless they take extra steps to make sure the trucks are in SAFE working order. Can't believe they were so careless.",0
"Easy process and as long as you pay attention to the ""add ons"" decently priced!",0
Staff counter were very rude and aholish! Very unfriendly and unhelpful! Lady named Kimberly was very unaccomodating and it seems she did not wanted to be there working at all. Rude as heck!!,0
I have rented from this facility on multiple occasions and have always left happy. I don't worry about issues when I rent here. I have had concerns in the past and they have proven to me to be fair and prompt in their responses.,0
"Great Service! Great Experience! I read the reviews for all the U-Haul business in Anchorage and many of them are negative. I'm happy to say that my experience was positive, so here are ( 5 TIPS ) to help make your experience positive too! 1. Call 2-3 days prior to renting. Some of the rentals require a 24 hour notice. I called twice after 5PM, on hold twice for over 20 minutes, and I had to hang-up twice. Call earlier in the day to reach a U-Haul employee. 2. Look at the dimensions of the U-Haul rental online. If you rent a (6x12) Cargo Trailer you'll need to know the door opening is (4'10""x5') if you plan to load something large. 3. Rentals have a return time, so make sure you know when to return the rental! I rented a 12' utility trailer at 8AM and I was told to return it by 2PM. 4. You can't rent from one U-Haul location and return it at another without asking permission. The Traffic Manager must allow the return to another U-Haul location. 5. Returning the U-Haul rental to another U-Haul location IS NOT FREE! I rented a 12' utility trailer for $44.95 and the cost to drop off at another location would've been another $44.95. If these tips were helpful please click that like button!",0
"Slow. The last 3 times I called this location I ended up on hold until I hung up, 10-20 minutes later",0
Always able to rent a truck when I need one. Only drawback is having to wait in line sometimes.,0
"Went here twice because of its proximity. Both times there is a long line and only one person at the counter. Both times took half an hour just to get to the said counter and people kept showing up then leaving due to the wait. I don't know if it's understaffed or this is standard operation. As of this writing, 10 minutes till closing, one customer is haggling over priced and getting a walkthrough of different storage units. If there is any kind of management on premises they need to keep an eye on this toward close. Either assign someone to help, or man a counter yourself for a few. This way you don't have a line of people waiting half an hour at an empty counter while the lone salesman does a walking tour for someone.... Who admittedly did not plan on getting a unit today. Better yet have a manager take that over so the salesman can get other customers through.",0
Long lines and super short staffed they have just one person working at the desk the whole time,0
Clerk wasn't very smart and didn't let us rent the trailer that we needed,0
Easy in and out. Tim was very helpful and on his game. I think Uhaul is lucky to have him.,0
Refilled a 30# propane tank. Staff friendly and helpful. Price was very reasonable. Will return the next time I need more propane.,0
"Numerous examples of a poorly run place, but the best was someone had blocked me in from leaving. The person (seemingly in their own vehicle) was talking to an employee. They were laughing and carrying on with one another, all while I waited to leave. Then, the person gets out of their vehicle and walks away. And it's not as though they had just blocked me into a parking spot, but rather I was pulling around from the back of the building to leave and had to stop for them. More than one employee was in view of all this and said nothing that they may want to move their vehicle and not block the exit. It's a really tight lot to begin with. Not once did I have a positive experience going to this place.",0
Always have a good experience here. I'm in and out with a trailer I need every time without fail. Keep up the good work.,0
"Went here to get a uhaul with my buddy to get him moved into my place, they denied me because of the way I smelled? They were NOT polite about it either. I do not reccomend.",0
"DO NOT GET A HITCH INSTALLED here. They rescheduled me 3 separate times and when I went to pick up my car the mechanic said he had to â€˜jerry rigâ€™ the eclectronics to make it work...WHAT!? To make matters worse, the second time I went in to pick up the car they said they had left me a voicemail after they called saying the car really wasnâ€™t ready...They left the voicemail on a wrong phone number.",0
I rent a car hauler or dolly a few times a year here. I never have to wait long and I am out the door quick. Equipment is always in top shape too.,0
"Well equipped and helpful. Plenty of storage, supplies to move with such as boxes, tape, locks, dollies, so much more.",0
"I have never had a terribly positive experience here, it doesn't help that any calls here can be routed to the lower 48. When getting my hitch to install myself they were clueless on any detail included. Glad i did it myself. The place is very understaffed and has been the same since about the 90s. Called the day prior to getting a truck and the lady on the phone tried to misrepresent availability, fishing for my card to ""reserve a truck that i can't be sure will be here when you arrive"". Yet, the next morning i pull up and the lot is packed with rental trucks. There were plenty of employees from what i saw, which was much different from my previous trips. Renting a truck is way more sketchy and seems like a huge liability in more ways than 7 from what i remember. The truck works at least, and we will see how i fare returning it.",0
"Well stocked with moving boxes. I returned the extras for a full credit, very easy.",0
"This place has climate controlled storage, and the rental equipment is in excellent condition. If you need moving or shipping supplies, this is the place to go.",0
It is a good safe way to get it done,0
These guys are real nice and filled my propane tank in a timely manner.,0
"Good, be on time.",0
Wrong profesA2saw Azzam as awe wA wearing ps z Ã½zipsir guy behind the counter...I shall call him Richard. Guy is a man baby no skills in customer service. Hey guy with the butt rag lend it to Richard hes chapped!,0
Great customer service,2
"I've never had a good experience with this location. I've used this location twice in the last couple years and I've gotten nebulous answers from their customer service reps. This last case in particular I was assisting my mother in moving to Palmer. We tried to return the truck when I got a call from the Anchorage Old Seward office telling us the truck was due back all the way in Anchorage. We had the rep in the Matsu Valley office check for us, and he also told us we couldn't return it to the Matsu office. This led to us having to drive the truck all the way back to Anchorage incurring additional rental time, mileage and gas costs. I told the rep we were moving TO Palmer, and he never mentioned to me it wasn't a one way rental? Absolutely atrocious. I'll never rent from this location again.",0
The employees at this location are particularly helpful. More so than in my other experiences with this company,0
Decent prices on packing stuff. Check out slooow,0
Fast service. They will get you in and out asap.,0
Super helpful and friendly. Had everything you need for a move,0
"Good customer service, the lot is a little cramped though and where to park your car can be confusing.",0
Basic U-Haul rental business. Good service,0
It's a big hub. Lots of trucks and plenty of extras like boxes and moving supplies.,0
Very easy to work with and schedule a truck rental,0
Good price good truck.,0
Did not have the equipment as reserved. staff was less than helpful,0
In and out quick.,0
Its a place to rent trucks an stuff.,0
Always friendly people,2
Painless truck rentals,2
Good people and fast,0
The service terribly sorry,0
Wait was long checking inðŸ˜£,0
"The Oiler's Ball Field is where the local baseball team, the Oiler's, play. The tickets are cheap and if your lucky, they're free (when a company sponsors the game). The players come from all over the U.S. hoping to be grabbed up by a talent scout. There's a concession stand and a mascot. Come join the fun!",0
Great place to see the Alaska League baseball but no place to escape the sun or rain.,0
We love watching the boys play here. Its always fun for the whole family. Clean and well cared for.,0
Alaska Baseball League has families host College men playing baseball while enjoying Alaska. Not a great park but tickets only $8 or $5 to bleachers.,0
Baseball is back,2
Oilers are our favorite team!,0
I love their spicy sause with the grilled chicken. I also reccomend the grilled egg rolls. 5 minutes or so wait on food. Only downside is that prices are a bit high.,0
"I have been meaning to add my feedback and finally had time today. Place was clean and staff was good but slow. I just ordered on my way to my doctor appointment and ate inside. The food was cold by the time I got it and sat down. I felt that was strange. I could have complained but just ate it. If you order, the food should not be cold. Everything else was okay. I see it is temp closed and was willing to give it a second try.",0
"Freshly made, but fast food model of Asian foods. Better flavors and fresher than Safeway, although pricier that Safeway. Good quantity of food. Spicy dishes are perfect. The others are a little bland.",0
Thank God another decent food place opened in Kenai. It's better than McDonald's and often times cheaper. Not to mention leagues healthier!,0
"Hands down one of the better Asian food choices on the Peninsula! The other one is in Ninilchik a much further drive, but now we have an awesome place here close to home. Consistency is extremely important anywhere you go here, and that is what I have experienced here so far. Always, and yes I mean always, they have the same quantity of meat, vegetables, and rice. Not just quantity either, but the quality sets them at a very high bar. I could eat here every night and still look forward to my next meal!",0
Awesome place. Owner is on site most of the times we go in. Salmon bowls are to die for. The new ice cream bar has about twenty flavors and a broad choice of toppings.,0
Used to be good then they started rinsing the rice so it is gross. This is suppose to be a Japanese style place to eat and yet no Asian would ever rinse the rice. Cant dat finded rice with chopsticks.,0
I love getting the dark chicken teriyaki bowl and the pot stickers are my most fav.,0
Always get my order wrong or short maybe they all stoners,0
It was ok,2
"Best church ever. Was only their for a year, Pasted Steve kudos to you .My husband and I enjoyed the experience, God is good all the time .God is great al the time.",0
Love this place. Presents of God is alive and thriving here.,0
New Life is welcoming and loving. We felt at home immediately.,0
Love this church.,2
This place is rad! Awesome how they point out games that have LGBTQ or female characters. Staff is friendly and helpful. My husband just loves the place with their vintage games!! We definitely have to go back soon.,0
"I am very impressed with the new location, but I'm even more impressed by the level of service. The last time I stopped by I had a clerk emerge from the shadows like a friggin ninja to ask if I needed help. Not only did he not blink when I asked after an obscure game, he recommended others in the same series, including two I hadn't heard of. Also citing lovely experiences are my notoriously impatient wife and my tech-illiterate mother, who both have lovely stories about how nicely treated they were.",0
Awesome store for gamers. 100% recommend this place. You can find A TON of great games and really awesome old consoles that you'd have to buy online and pay a fortune for shipping. The owners are also real it nice. Support this shop!,0
Well this place didn't last long. Going too big too soon Casey. Putting any of your products on craigslist to compensate your loss?,0
"Great store. Owners and employees are cool, had a good, broad knowledge of most games. Friendly and helpful. Disc repairs, battery replacements, consignments, etc.",0
Best game store and they helped me with alot of questions,0
"Great service, friendly atmosphere, all around great place!",0
"Nice little game store, not always open",0
My son loves this place!,0
Many varieties of games and consoles,0
"I am a broker of a Rental Property Management company (RPM) and need to work with other Association Property Management companies to solve issues. PMSI over the years has been responsive, invoicing is clean for the clients, and their vendors they select follow through. All of which is helpful with we are working with Landlord, Tenant, Rental PM, HOA PM. With this many hands it gets confusing at times.",0
Employees all the way up to upper management were respectful welcoming and knowledgeable,0
Mouthpieces for an out of state corporation. Garbage people.,0
Great customer service from all of the ladies who work there. Always willing to help go through any questions you might have!,0
PMSI is the best. They are on top of everything and work with you to resolve any homeowner issue.,0
"Gave us the wrong documents that we paid $250 for on a flash drive so I had to make an extra trip out to the valley to fix the problem. Space is dingy and dated, Staff is rude and no one in the office wears shoes. Gross. This month they sent out notice of HOA meeting for the 22nd. When the lady never showed up someone called. They said that it was a typo and the meeting wasn't until the 27th. HOA's pay them a lot of money and they can't even show up to a 1 hour meeting annually.",0
The best management company in Anchorage. A++,0
"After working many years in Property Management, I decided to change careers and move north to Alaska. I've invested in several condos, which happen to be managed by PMSI. Over the past 6 years, I've had ZERO problems with the staff, management, or policies put in place by PMSI. As someone with extensive property management experience, I have high expectations for the quality of service I receive, and PMSI has been nothing but exceptional in meeting those expectations. I see several negative reviews here, and I can say with confidence that these are likely residents that may be upset with the regulations of their HOA and are taking their frustration out on PMSI. Give them a fair chance and make a decision about them based on your experience, I know they won't let you down!",0
They manage our house.,0
I have had a bad shoulder for over ten years and seen many chiropractors. This is the only one the gave me relief after one treatment. I was able to hold my posture without pain and only had to make another apt in 6months for another treatment I had never gone that long without pain. I would recommend this chiropractor to anyone.,0
I was experiencing pain from a pinched nerve in my lower back and Dr. Mike was able to fix it. Highly recommend his chiropractic work.,0
6 stars man. Amazing full body adjustments and Dr. Mike is a kind and friendly soul. Glad to have found you Dr. Mike!!,0
"I walked in and about 20 minutes later I felt like my world had changed. Then I got out of the massage chair and met the chiropractor. Ha ha Iâ€™m just joking. In all honesty this is a very good doctor, very honest and I would definitely recommend him to friends and people who just ask me. A no nonsense kind a guy and very trustworthy 10/10 and will be going back. Also, let me say this. Often times the doctor can be good but the front office staff can be complete jags, which will make me never come back. The front office person very personable very friendly and another great person to work with.",0
"After weeks of discomfort and years of body tension, I decided to go back to chiropractic care. I'm so pleased with how my body has responded! I've been so ""off"" for so long, I'd forgotten what it's like to take a full, deep breath and feel balanced. Very pleased with the office staff, the pricing structure and the results working with Dr. Mike. I have a ways to go because I've been away from chiropractic care for SO long, but I am thrilled with the progress I've already seen!",0
Customer service is amazing doesn't feel like a regular business place. Very family oriented and professional. Dr. Mike is very personable and really listens to you and adjust accordingly. Highly recommended,0
"I fell asleep wrong this past Thursday night and my right hand was tingling and numb all day. I called early Friday morning, thinking maybe massage therapy might get this pinched nerve smoothed out. During treatment it was suggested to get an alignment. I thought yes that might make it better. OK so got my massage and alignment, make a few stops still had the tingling sensation, I couldn't do anything all day...ie hold a pen, open my phone (fingerprint recognition), just basically not have a tight grasp on anything without feeling like my hand was in fire. Long story short waking up 2am Saturday morning I am 98% better than I was earlier. I know I still have to give it time, but Dr. Mike was awesome in helping to release the tension and tightness in my neck and get my nerve openings back on track. So if you find yourself having slept wrong, and in need of treatment, go see Dr. M at True Life Chiropractic. Staff is wonderful and friendly. Ready to go back for another adjustment and massage therapy session....",0
"Outstanding! I went in with a lower back and hip pain after so many years as an Airborne Infantry Soldier and a parachute malfunction accident, I came out feeling almost no pain at all, 95% of the pain went away. It's been years since I felt this good.",0
stopped by as a walk in and received amazing chiropractic care! definitely will be my go to for future sessions!,0
Fantastic Chiropractor and great staff. I always had a headache after neck adjustments but had no problems this time around. And took away almost all the pain I'd had in my foot from falling and twisting my ankle.,0
Fixed my shooting pain to my legs and help me walk without pain. Highly recommended.,0
"I have had 7 prior chiropractors before Dr Michaud and he has been the best. When pregnant my hips/round ligament would get very tight and he always made it better with one visit(had a very healthy boy). When I had a miscarriage I was a train reck and having chiropractic really helped in the recovery process. For years I've twisted my ankles and the first time he adjusted them if changed the life of my ankles! Every now and then they'll get wobbly but I go in and he fixes them, I'm good for 6 months or so. I've been his patient since before he graduated from chiropractic college. My whole family sees him, from my grandma who's 80 to my son who was a month old when he first saw him.",0
"Was a ""Frankenstein"" when the Doctor fist saw me. Had a fall during the winter & the left rear area of my head hit a vehicle bumper, I went down, blacken out & drew up into a fetal position & remember thinking to my self, this isn't a good thing. Took a year for the problem to surface & had an MRI to reveal the damages to my C5,6,&7 vertebrae. Been @ TLC since about February & pain is reduced & am working on getting motion back caused from fall. Going 2 or 3 times weekly & treatments are working using Trigger Point, Massage, EMS, Ultrasound, & adjustment by Dr. Mike Michaud. He is a "" no drugs"" doctor & very attentive to his patience's & their problems. Highly recommended.",0
"Excellent, caring treatment. Happy atmosphere!",0
Basically I feel like a loosey goosey gummy worm ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,0
Amazing walked out feeling brand new,0
"Very nice fields for softball/ other field sporting activity, generous number of well-kept port-a-potties/rent-a-cans, & another plus* no unexpected wildlife encounters. The only reason I'm giving Javier De la Vega Park a 4-star rating, rather than a 5-star rating, is because of the fact that it's so well-hidden from the public's direct line of sight... (in my personal opinion: the sign should be more visible to people from the highway!) Anyhow, I've lived here 10+ years & never even knew it was there, thank you! ðŸ‘",0
"Pssst, my secret safe place to bring the vicious. Just remember to clean up after your pet. Maybe a few junkies camped out. but hey, who does not prepare for contingencys? Moose, bear, whatever.",0
Was not easy to find. But area is over all well kept and clean. Porter potties surprisingly very well kept.,0
Good park nice people,0
Great place to play some softball.,0
I enjoy playing softball there.,0
"Not easy access for mobility challenged people, particularly to the back fields.",0
Our tour guide went Above & Beyond to make sure we had a very educational & enjoyable tour of the Oscar Anderson House. Great memories for the family. Thank you!,0
"Visited the park after hours to take a look at the house. Really enjoyed the plaques outside that had some of the history and also stories behind some of the naming in the region. Found the story about the crazy pilots who tried to explore the interior of Alaska very enlightening. Also, crazy to imagine Anderson having to work so hard to get to Anchorage back in the day - makes me feel the drive wasn't so bad after all.",0
Cool museum. This place was listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.,0
Lots of great information on the tour.,0
"(Translated by Google) Nice and interesting. Too bad we had to go at reduced hours. Very kind, affable and explanatory guide (Original) Bello ed interessante. Peccato che siamo dovuti andare ad orari ridotti. Guida molto gentile, affabile ed esplicativa",0
Love this place but some bad campers don't clean there sites. And city does not clean up them either. Two bags of trash been sitting for 3 days at a site and there is a dumpster to use. But again all campers aren't nice so city needs to check sites after check outs.,0
"Views are great. Campground is well maintained. Lots of spots under the trees or in the clear. They have porta potties, a dumpster and trash can on sight and a potable water spicket across the street. Great experience staying.",0
Perfect place to be an American and celebrate the 4th of July weekend camping and watching fireworks in Alaska!,0
The public restrooms are cleaned very regularly and are well stocked. Reservations are easily made online. Seward has moved to the top of my listed of most beautiful places visited,0
I like that the have a fire pit. They should have a flush able toilet kind of bathroom. I love Seward.,0
Williams campground is a reasonably nice place to pitch a tent in local area. It is kept rather clean and its nice to be able to have a. camp fires in the evenings. Though I do think $10 per night is a bit steep it should be $5.,0
Amazing view of the Resurrection Bay and My Marathon!!,0
Lot's of road noise early in the a.m.,0
Great Camping Grounds,2
"Portion looked a little bit small for $5.50. ""It had better be good ice cream,"" I thought. Folks, it was better than I hoped. Places like Cold Stone have good ice cream, sure. The difference was like expecting a decent speaker and a radio performance of a song, and getting a live band performance instead. The flavors and richness were explosively vivid! I'm having to take my time with this because the flavors are complex and powerful and real. Worth a special trip.",0
"Me and my wife came and bought three different ice creams to try, the lemon, snickers, and banana cream ones. They were all extremely well crafted and tasted marvelous. I don't think there is another home grown place in Alaska that could come close to the quality we experienced here. Also, considering they are fairly new, I feel like they have the potential to get better and better and really become something super special as they grow. Can't wait to try new flavors as they add more, you guys are doing great!",0
"Went on a whim because road trips need ice cream and was blown away. Ice cream was reasonably priced for specialty, good portion sizes and DELICIOUS. WOW!",0
"Holy beans! The ice cream is dang good! This must be the place to go cuz it was busy but understand why. The service was courteous and friendly, and the moved the long line right along.",0
"Amazing staff, Amazing owner, and THE best ice cream in town.",0
New ice cream shop in the valley that serves great ice cream.,0
Little bit to much milk in the shakes (strawberry) but everything else was delicious!,0
Their icecream is sooo good. It's one of my favorite places to go now,0
Great local spot with amazing ice cream!,0
Handmade local ice-cream ðŸ¦,0
Great ice cream and the best workers!,0
Fast and smart and experienced agents. My man Guillermo is da bomb! He was quick and helpful. Very nice,0
"Love our tax preparer Michelle, but the rest of the office seems in need of an overhaul. The front desk always seems to be quite rude. Even if they are just sitting there staring out the window they are to busy for phones or customers.",0
"March 4, 2019 - updated 3/8/19 - updated 3/15/19 Great people and relaxed setting just make sure your Tax Pro has a few years of experience to prevent any hiccups. I recommend H&R over other tax preparation places due to their up front pricing and no hidden fees. The manager at this location is very professional.",0
The person who has been doing my taxes for the past few years is great. She is th ereason I keep coming back,0
Very friendly I can say that but them receiveing 500 to do my taxes of coarse there going to be friendly. They just aren't very knowledgeable I imagine they just hire anyone off the street anyway they told me to expect my return on the 18th it's the 18th come to find out I'm not getting to get it until March because of the path act which they should have told me about when I was there not on the day I was expecting my return. shame,0
Michelle definitely made me feel confident and explained the process of my refund. I will be seeing her next year,0
It was real bad,0
"Made an appointment for 9:30 am, walked in 5 minutes early, and eventually left at 10:15 am because Don never came out to get me for the appointment. I sat at the front and didn't know what was going on. No one at the front desk either. The store was open, but apparently they didn't want my business and have lost it for good. Avoid H&R block and go elsewhere.",0
The people here are no help I have got an emerald advance every year for the past three years and they input the rong stuff and a got denied becuz of there ignorance my kids won't have the Christmas that they deserve so thank u hr block for nothing..,0
"Basically walk in, double check and done!",0
"I made an appointment for 2pm, on line. I waited until 3:20. I spoke with a tax professional and she couldn't help me. The worst.",0
Had no heat in my car. I got there and they were closed but i used the over night key drop. My car was ready by noon the next day with heat. Im nice and warm again,0
Very honest and knowledgeable. Great place!,0
"I love this shop. As a guy who drives to anchorage from wasilla everyday, It is nice to have an honest mechanic right off the highway. I have used car care center for years. They treat my old broken down cars just like new ones. I noticed comments about them being rude. I have never experienced this. This is my mechanic...he can be a little rude, I don't want some sweet talking upselling salesman.",0
Not friendly and they did not get the job done,0
Super rude people. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place.,0
Great staff! Very responsive and they are on top of things!!,0
When my alternator died they were able to get it in and get it replaced in a matter of couple of days. Really fast efficient reasonably priced and kind service! I will be coming back God forbid if something happens!,0
Great Pandemic Protocols! Love the honesty and transparency.,0
"I have nothing but good to say about everyone here. I've been bringing my vehicles here for 4+ years now and trust no one else with my vehicles now. Best shop I've been to, outside of Alaska included, no questions.",0
"Wonderful shop! Great staff, great owner, honest, & kind! Quick turn around! My go to place :)",0
Called to get a quote on my truck..some gal named wendy answered..she wouldnt even listen to what i needed done..because i wasnt a current or past customer..how do u get new customers if wendy wont listen to them..get a new secretary to answer ur phone..preferably one with people skills and is able to listen...,0
Alex is the best! Definitely enjoy my pick ups here for supplies. They have really stepped up their process with ensuring products are ready for clients and the friendly staff definitely a plus !,0
"Fantastic customer service! We came in, told them what we were looking for, and they were such a great help and getting us what we needed! We will definitely be back in the future, and will definitely recommend this place to others! Just a warning though, the guys next door donâ€™t like anyone parking in their area and will threaten to tow you. So just be aware of where you park.",0
Great place to do business with.,0
"It's nice to find a privately owned place like this in Anchorage. Bill and the staff at M&M have been extremely supportive and helpful. I came here because I couldn't find what I needed for my BBQ catering event at the big box stores. I was expecting to pay a premium for having waited to the last minute; what I found was incredibly competitive prices, friendly, accommodating, down to earth people and amazing service. From now on M&M is going to be my first stop.",0
I go the shop next to it. I dont know the place....,0
Wonderful group of people eagerly to fulfill your needs. I highly recommend.,0
Great for supplies-i get my yeast and syrups and other hard to find supplies there,0
"Very friendly crew and willing to drop everything and run get my order together, before I get my wallet out on the counter",0
"Been doing business with them for many years for good reasons. Prices are reasonably competative and great customer service. But as a business, the key component that makes them stand out above and beyond other corporate business is their continuous willingness to accomodate, service, and support. They are a fine example of good businss practice in principle and integrity.",0
They are trying for the develop. Most of employees are humble.,0
Alaskas Best whole sale distributor,0
They are a great company,0
"Fast,friendly and polite",2
Best wholesale distributor in Anchorage.,0
More product for coffee shop,0
"Nice, Beautiful & Courtesy",0
It was a small group but a good NA meeting all in all the people were friendly and the building was easy to find with the assistance of Google maps,0
"Great 12step program, because I needed to get serious about my recovery to stay alive",0
This place is a safe place to meet others and seek help,0
I like this place,0
Gettin it done from 7pm to 8pm... When I can anyway.,0
Good simple food. Love a good burger here's the place.,0
It works if u work it. Keep coming back!,0
Great place with great people who care.,0
Perfect place for the support you need,0
Great AA and NA meetings.,0
"Nice & clean, & coffee is always on",0
"I always come to the store at 6 at night. Now I've been standing in line for half an hour and they tell me, I have to come back another time Because they can't make copies after 6:30 they're getting ready to close.Every other time I've came here the Employees have been nothing but nice and helpful. However, tonight this older lady was just plain rude and dismissive. She was so rude in fact that I will probably never come back to this store again. And unfortunately I'm not the only person she's been rude to cuz the next customer behind me in line is now walking out in tears",0
"They offer post office services and so much more. They are a bit more expensive than the USPS postal boxes, but the price includes so much more.",0
Always helpful and courteous service,0
Really helpful and fast friendly service.,0
Very thankful to all the employees and owner for helping us in our time of grief. They all helped us with the faxing back and forth to take of our needs over our son's death in anther state. Thank you so much.,0
Great staff helps with large items that are sent to our box happy with the services,0
They threw away legal mail without owners permission.,0
Had a PO Box here for awhile. The staff were always very friendly and said hello and welcome every time I walked in. Props to the staff here.,0
"It's a recovery church. He does not stick behind those who stick behind them. Has two sides and if you are of no use to him. You get one side. If he can get something from you, he will promise you the after life. Unless you pocket book runs dry.",0
I lost connection and Faith in alot of Reas of my life. . After attending church of God with pastor Humphries it has helped restore my Faith.. Thank You this church really is a God send! !,0
Every time I go to kenai this is where I go to church.. very friendly and accepting of who you are... Highly recommend,0
"The best church in Soldotna. With Podcast, TV Show, Media presentations with sermons are top of the line motion video. Very friendly people. Pastor Humphries is very down to earth, and approachable.",0
Love this place amazing worship and the word of God is good here,0
"Excellent charter service! Prompt, courteous and extremely helpful! Took excellent care of us and our gear!",0
Great privately owned fleet of planes. Owners are super friendly and helpful. Flew us over the icefield and it was amazing.,0
Was very helpful and courteous. I will gladly do business with them in the future.,0
Dennis at Ward Air was great! We had a great tour of Pack Creek and Admirality Island.,0
"There use to be a show called ""Wings"" It could have been called Ward Air :) Professional through-and-through, always appreciate their company.",0
"Jimbo gets busy! But you get a pile of food. Wish I ordered the fish n' chips sounds like that's ðŸ”¥ on the menu. They were sold out by 2:30 pm on the fish.... Dog friendly too, extra ðŸŒŸ just for that!",0
Iâ€™ve never had such an amazing roast beef French dip. Canâ€™t wait to check out the rest of the menu. It seems like every order gets fries made fresh for each plate; no pre-made batches. Portions are huge and perfect for either repacking calories expended at Hatcherâ€™s or taking home leftovers.,0
There's not a lot of options for lunch if you're headed up to Hatcher Pass for the day. We stopped there on our way back out and it was very good. Homemade fries and good burgers.,0
Not Summer without going to Jimbo's!,0
I like Jimbo's guy has great food tables on the outside heck of a view in fact I just wrote down the address so I can take my wife,0
Expedient service for great food and conveniently located!,0
"Checked out the bar, I liked it. I wanna go back, but the wife wasnt a fan. I like those old rustic bars tho.",0
Just great food. Plentiful and at a good price.,0
Really good food all of it I have had is great,0
"I had heard rumors of it and finally decided to go. Awesome burger, fresh ingredients and Jim is very personable.",0
Giant portions and friendly service.,0
A real hamburger. Nuff said.,0
"Yummy food, every time.",0
Amazing pulled pork,2
I visit regularly because of our big family of cars and I just love these guys!,0
Work well done at a fair price!,0
Would give them five stars because of everybody's recommendations. But worked on my daughter's air conditioning and now the dial for the heat does not work and we have to take it back and get a part ordered $500 later. So my word would be questionable in some areas. I'm not sure the air conditioning will be fixed?,0
"I'm new to the area and picked Jenski, at first, because they were a fee dollars cheaper then others. I continue to bring them my business because of Bayli. She is very helpful and makes sure I'm happy with the service. She gets my car in asap and double checks her work. The gentleman at the front desk was very nice and kept checking on me as I was using their free WI-FI in the lobby. They offer rides to and from, if needed, so I didn't have to wait there.",0
They know their stuff. I pretty much only take my vehicle to them. Pretty fast service and reliable and knowledgeable mechanics.,0
They fixed up my girlfriends car and did some amazing work.,0
"Work is always done on time, and the staff is super friendly!",0
Staff is great! A great family business!,0
The food is good. The boiled scallops were very tender and halibut creole was tasty. The service is however subpar. Waiters were irresponsible and too busy serving many tables.,0
The food had very little flavor. We ordered as a group and only when the food arrived for all of us they informed us that one of the ingredients was missing so they didn't bring the dish. Most of the meals didn't feel fresh and the sauce was thin. They really shouldn't charge these prices for such meals.,0
Decent italian food by Alaska standards. Waiter was attentive. Prices are average for small town Alaska. Great views. Is attached to the Best Western. Only open for dinner.,0
"I'm not sure when this happened, but Roma's is probably the best restaurant in town right now. Even existing items on the menu have changed drastically for the better. The new menu is really really really good. Maybe they have a new chef, I'm not sure but I'll be eating here a lot more now.",0
Great food. I had the sampler and the New York steak. Super delicious and great service. would definitely return.,0
"Wonderful food. But the worst service I have ever had. This is not just one instance of bad service, this is at least the 4th time I have had terrible service on a night that wasn't all that busy.",0
Pretty good food. Awesome Halibut Creole.,0
The best place in Valdez for dinner,0
This restaurant is no longer open please update,0
"The physicians assistant is so amazing, we have the best conversationâ¤ï¸",0
Was sent to see Sarah M. for a massage as a bday gift..... it was the absolute best!!,0
"I've been going to Pairmore & Young for about a month. I went because a friend recommended it. Honestly I was skeptical, but I have to admit it's starting to help. Dr. Jerz was very clear about what she hoped to accomplish and told me that it wasn't going to happen right a way. In the last month I've noticed my pain decrease, I'm able to do more and I'm not reaching for the Tylenol, ice, and heat everytime I finish a chore like I was. That had changed my skepticism into hope. I recommend that if your having pain that you give Pairmore and Young a try, they have proven to me they will be right up front with what they can and can't help your with.",0
"I've been receiving care from Pairmore & Young for a few years now, and I'm very pleased with the results I'm experiencing. I still have a ways to go but I'm grateful for their treatment. The establishment in Anchorage is very comfortable and clean, and the staff are very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly.",0
Great crew. Dr. Connie is awesome and really helps my spine. Thanks so much. I have the best care in America. If you want pain relief you should call now Thanks to Dr Young for your help...,0
"What an outstanding office. I recently had the opportunity to tour their facilities. No more closed in, cramped little adjustment rooms. Very professional adjustment studios that are very tasefully laid out. You should check this firm out for your needs!",0
Would recommend this group a very talented people to all my friends.,0
Beautiful property and lots of great activities for children based on a great foundation of Biblical principles. Couldn't ask for more!,0
Nice quiet and secluded place. Great lake for swimming and kayaking,0
Staff needs help but great camp.,0
Both my son and daughter have gone to this camp since 2006...it is a wonderfully caring place for youth growth!,0
Camp & Conference center. Great facility.,0
Great place for kids to learn about God.,0
Great place to go and eat.,0
Great staff great experiences,0
Great homeschool day camp!,0
My girls loved the summer camp!,0
Great spot for lattes and coffee! Friendly staff,0
Very nice always willing to make whatever crazy concoction the kids want never greedy on the whip cream this place has the best drinks,0
Great service. The 5th ave location is closing at the end of April 2018 but the Bailey's location is still open,0
Get my wife n I coffee every morning from this place. Friendly people and quick service,0
I stop by here every morning. The girls are super sweet and have only messed up my order once.,0
All I can say is YUMMY,0
Best redbull drinks in town,0
Red Bull Special is amazing!,0
Awesome service & smoothy,0
Love the sugar shack,0
Great people & service,0
"Friendly, fast, and awesome coffee!!",0
Lost of fresh made bread and other baked and cooked goods. Lots of imported goods,0
Wish it had more Dutch food - but it has great Eastern European food - the raisin sweet bread is yummy,0
"Daily fresh, real european rye bread straight from oven. Good variety of chocolate, cheese and lunch meats. German and russian bologna. Must visit store in Wasilla.",0
"Really neat little store to buy all your specific European ingredients. I stop by when I have a specific recipe that calls for an international ingredient they carry or for a sweet treat. My husband loves the Turkish delight and I love the other sweet treats. Homemade cakes and sandwiches and lots of meats and pierogi! Only 4 stars because their not very friendly to locals who are not from their country. Or maybe their like that to everyone, who knows.",0
Great place where I got some deli meat for my kids.,0
"Got amazing meats, sausages, bread freshly baked, piroshki, cakes, candy and icecream just like from childhood simple and good!â­â­â­â­â­",0
Great place to find different types of snacks and drinks that you cant find anywhere else,0
What a great variety of specialty foods at reasonable prices,0
They have the best fruit gummies,0
Good place for semi obscure European restaurants ingredients and food.,0
"Very simple, but it's worth it. I like it. ðŸ‘",0
Great place if you like Eastern European food.,0
We went there and the people who worked there were very rude!,0
Lots of goodies to choose from. Friendly people too,0
Only place for Russian and Ukrainian food in Wasilla,0
Very high quality discerning employees. I couldn't sell awesome stuff that hadn't been worn or played with before. Seems like a good place.,0
Good place to buy kids clothes. Looks better than a Thrift store... but it is quite pricey,0
Staff is ok. Items were pretty good. Some of the prices were laughable for how used the items were. But over all good stuff.,0
Good place to swap kids clothes,0
Great quality items. Friendly staff.,0
Good place to buy for kids,0
"Store set up super weird. Prices high for a second hand store, in my opinion",0
They were friendly,2
"Good gas station. Holiday is always the cleanest with the best staff! Also Zack and Deven from maintenance are great so you don't see ""out of order"" very often!",0
The only gas station I prefer to go. I only go to other ones if there is not a Holiday near by or if I do not have enough gas to make it to one. I love their rewards programâ£,0
Nice clean store.,2
"Good people, good gas, good coffee. That's all I need....",0
Extra friendly and helpful staff. Great breakfast burrito!! I will make this a regular stop from now onðŸ‘. Been back a few times since original post. Every time we stop the food is great and the staff is wonderful. OMG the burgers are Good! I highly recommend the Granny's BBQ sauce too. They sell it by the bottle and it really is good enough to drink. Best breakfast burritos around...,0
"Very nice place, be sure to call ahead in time because their hours might vary from regular hours ""5am to Midnight"" to alternate hours ""6am to 10pm"". A lot of cool variety with ice cream",0
"Food was good, burger was big and juicy, waffle fries were fresh and tasty, great place to stop while your on the road to the peninsula.",0
Like the new look. Food is great with great prices. Everything you need in one stop. I'll keep coming back. Thanks,0
Went here today to get some Childrens Ibuprofen and Childrens Tylenol. They wanted over 25 dollars. Fred Meyers is less then 15 miles away and it is 5.99 each for the name brand stuff. You all are charging MORE THEN DOUBLE. You all should feel ashamed of yourselves. I am done coming here. You just lost this locals buisness.,0
"No joke, best food for miles. Burgers are my go-to.",0
"Cook's Corner is a great place with fast , friendly service and excellent food. If you haven't already stopped in there you should !",0
Great food nice people.,0
They have a monopoly on food and gas when your heading out of town and they know it.,0
They don't really like white guys around here. Guess I'll just have to shop at a different station.,0
"Terrible customer service, cashier paid more attention to her tablet than she did her customers, wouldnt reccomend this place, get your gas elsewhere.",0
"Great service for an ""in and out"" and large area to refuel your vehicle and clean its windows.. etc Don't count on the free air, because it really works and if it does there's (more often than not) not enough pressure to fill your tires. It's a very convenient location, and there's also a Redbox positioned outside. However, there are also a lot of panhandlers as well as drunks, especially during the night hours. Many of them get kicked out of the rescue mission for drinking, which is right across the street... so they often hang out in the local park by Campbell Creek and show up at this gas station as well. Fresh donuts delivered in the early morning hours, and hot coffee, etc. As with any convenient store, expect high prices, although some of their prices are reasonable. Wells Fargo ATM inside the store.",0
Love the coffee truly love the coffee really really I love the coffee good prices fast and friendly always have something hot going to eat,0
This place is amazing during the holidays,0
Great service. Thx guy's!,0
Bathrooms closed till 7am,0
"My go to spot for For drinks, food, or just about anything.",0
I love this gym. 24/7 and not crowded.,0
Awesome view and friendly safe services ðŸ‘,0
"Really love the gym and owners! Hate that people don't clean equipment after use, re-rack their weights, and play music without headphones",0
Very basic but has everything you need for a good work out,0
Juneau's best affordable gym option.,0
24 hours basic workout with no frills,0
Good place to work out,0
(Translated by Google) Location theft (Original) Goid location,0
They aren't very mindful of people expressing symptoms or living in their public restroom,0
"A great community space, incredible view, good place to read or work or bring kids. Worth a visit even if you're from out of town. Librarians know all the best things to see and do in Juneau.",0
"It's very BIG,& SPACIOUS,& has a huge window where you can overlook the Bay. I barely go into there, but when i do, i know how quite,& peaceful it is. You can relax, read books, or you CAN even get PFD FORM'S here too. It's a good place to go for a relaxing, peaceful time to spend alone, or with family, or friends, (as long as your quit.) But they are friendly,& kind there.ðŸŒˆðŸ”‡ðŸ”•ðŸ“–ðŸ“°ðŸ™ŠðŸ‘©ðŸ’»ðŸ‘âœðŸ’–ðŸ’— But,...i don't think they allow eating inside there, you'de have to ask them.",0
Best view of any library anywhere.,0
I thoroughly enjoy being a patron of the downtown branch. The staff is always courteous and helpful.,0
"This library's free WiFi fails to provide decent service and speed, unacceptable. I go there and am more times disappointed than not attempting to use their dismal internet. I get a connection, with an agonizingly slow connection, terminating my session and leaving, unable to update my apps on my smartphone.",0
"Great view, lots of seating, great peridical section",0
The best free wifi in all the village,0
"Great views, quiet and comfortable.",0
Centrally located and super friendly,0
"Horrible customer service, can never reach someone to talk to to address their own mistakes. Their own customer service phone numbers are worthless and it requires hours of digging, waiting, and multiple phone calls to reach someone.",0
I was trying to look up just a simple cost of a plan but the website makes you jump through too many hoops and it wouldn't accept my zip code. Just too complicated,0
I called and spoke with a spokesperson concerning insurance claims .. helped me update my information and although couldnâ€™t get what I wanted they helped giving me numbers to call for further information access... Most pleasant and helpful..,0
"Zero dollars for the appointment, was actually hundreds of dollars, since, apparently, Premera knows what testing I need more than my Doctor does.",0
"Four months no ID card. Still cannot create member portal. Representatives provide meaningless apologies and still I wait with no ID card to access benefits. CEO Jeff Roe received a $3,000,000 bonus in 2017 on top of his $73,500 per month salary. I ask why? Maybe it is his management style creates a good environment for investors and leaves members in the lurch. This is why the USA needs medicare for all. At least we would be able to vote out poor managers.",0
Unable to make payment on website. Server error. Called and waited 40min on hold. Representative was friendly and wanted to help but could not locate my previous payments. Their 2020 customer portal is broken. I had made payment in December but lady could not find any record of my payment. Today I made payment for full amount (January and February) on the automated phone system to make sure nothing is past due. In my paper statement it said $0 past due. This is unacceptable. Old customer portal worked fine. Now it is just confusion and errors.,0
Easy to navigate website,0
Incompetent rude screws everything up. Make 10 calls still canâ€™t make payments!!,0
Extremely dishonest. Assured me that my plan was cancelled 3 times (after 6 or 7 hours on the phone) and yet have now taken out two payments for a plan that does not exist.,0
I was on the phone for 1 hour and 41 mins waiting to talk to someone.,0
"Hold time is 30 minutes all day, every day. Even if you're being transferred from one dept to the next.",0
"They are totally weathless. The hole time I have had my plan I have been unable to use it as they have me as a male, 20 years older than I am. They are unwilling me to fix the problem",0
"Heather is great! She is honest, personable, patient and gives good advice if you ask her for it. We always feel well taken care of. I would highly recommend her for your insurance needs. She is a great agent. I have had many different ones over the years and she is my favorite.",0
"My biggest dissatisfaction is that I never get to talk to ""Jake from State Farm"". That aside, Heather has always been super helpful and is always knowledgeable whenever I've had issues. I know I will get the best service. If by some chance I don't actually speak to her about my needs I can guarantee I'll get a phone call back at her earliest convenience. My biggest suggestion would be to check with her before you make life purchases because she can help think of issues that may arise that you wouldn't think of.",0
Excellent Customer Service!,2
"Was good for about 4 years until rates continued to climb with no claims ever made. $3,600 yearly for two liability and one full coverage is ridiculous. Saved $1,000 with Allstate! Plans are simple and easy to understand. No prorate bullcrap to fill out every few months, no more outrageous incorrect bills to straighten out every 3 months.",0
This location has been my insurance place since 1988. Always easy to make changes,0
"I been going thru Heather Andrus State Farm here in Anchorage for awhile and I couldn't ask for a better support team ever! I trust them with my car insurance, life insurance and even my rental insurance. Amazing staff and always there to explain in every way you need it fit. My agent mariann is a god sent! Highly recommend this location ðŸ’¯",0
Very helpful and great customer service,0
"Great Insurance, Great Agents!",0
Gotta have Insurance,2
I made a new policy,0
"Nome is lucky to have a movie theater at all, and Gold Coast Cinema amazingly has comparable prices on tickets and concessions to theaters on the road system. Movies often arrive several weeks late, but that's part of life in rural Alaska.",0
"Movie theater in Nome. Seating is nice, stadium style. Good for what it is.",0
"The complete cinema experience - amphitheater seating, and accessible Subway.",0
Lovely little theatre just above Subway.,0
When passing time at Anchorage International Airport it is tough to beat the Upper Oneâ€™s combination of amazing view and cold beer. The chiliâ€™s not bad either.,0
Excellent service and excellent food/drinks!,0
A tucked-away gem with better ambiance than most airport bars worth the hike from the Alaska Airlines terminal to get there. Quesadilla was a bit overstuffed and soggy but tasted good. Service was prompt and professional.,0
Had a great time last night staff and patrons were friendly,0
I really like the staff here. Amazing nachos.,0
Nice workers good food quite restaurant,0
Prices are high because they target travelers as every place but cool staff so far,0
"Terrible food, good staff, good drinks.",0
Not a good place to get food,0
"I have always loved this campground. There is day use parking, and picnic tables if you just want to spend the day or use the boat launch. The camping spaces are nice and the road is paved. You do not want to bring rvs longer than 30 ft through here as the turns are pretty sharp for such large vehichles. Bring cash for the fee station",0
Awesome I definitely will go back,0
"We got lucky on this park since there was nobody there, not even a camp host. The wilds were a little bit overgrown for my taste and there was no water on site.",0
State parks are great!,0
"Great team, clean and bright place and my little pooch looks SO much better! Thanks again!",0
"I really liked it. I drove past, and saw it's a really nice building with a kind staff. My dog's usually make a fuss getting groomed and nails clipped but they loved the man who did it. Good people skills and got their nails cut perfectly short enough. Fair pricing, too!",0
Natalie did a great job with our sensitive dog. I will definitely make her our regular groomer.,0
"I have always been appreciative of, ""The Dog Wash "". They have always done a great job on both of my Yorkies and when I go to pick them up, they are happy and smiling!",0
They did a great job on the dog the wife loved the haircut the dog was not stressed out must have had a great time getting lots of attention. pricing was just right. We will go back.,0
"They were able to get the dog in same day, dropped her off and within 2 hours she was ready to be picked up. I was very happy with the services provided, not too ridiculously expensive but still came back with a ton of shedding hair. Granted it may not be something they could fix in one visit",0
They put a cute little bandana on my pupper,0
Fast friendly service. They are just great with our little dog ðŸ¶,0
Excellent and fast service even for my stranger aggressive puppy. They were so patient with her and did an excellent job making her not stink!,0
They do a great job on my dog,0
Good quick service. Very considerate of pets and people.,0
Very friendly fast service thank you!,0
My babies love going to the Dog washðŸ’ž,0
They always do a great job cutting my schnauzer,0
They always take really good care of my dog and dont mind his incessant barking,0
They are decent could go shorter on my pup but im sure if I ask for it I'll get it next time pretty fast also,0
Love it they are very personal and professional and do an excellent job on my dog.,0
"Always great service that takes care of my 2 dogs. One very large and one medium, both don't like to get washed, but the ladies always make it happen. I highly recommend.",0
"Jill was great with our Charlie. He looks and smells great. His coat is soft, fluffy, and he is happy. Happy dog=happy dog owner We will be back :)",0
Handled our recent rescue so well and that was very important to us!!,0
"Lindsey does a fabulous job on our doodle girls, Trixie and Daisy!",0
love this place,2
My Malamute-Husky mix always comes out to clean and fluffy!,0
I've taken all my dogs here threw out my whole life and can't see going anywhere else,0
"Excellent Staff, Service and Facility. Been a customer Since 2000",0
Nobody wearing masks!,2
Best place to take the doggies,0
There an Awesome Baseball team from my Home town Kenai Alaska i like watching them Play Baseball.The games are packed alot too.Especially the free Games a couple in a Season!!,0
College kids playing in Alaska. No stadium lights needed,0
What's not to love about our Peninsula Oiler's,0
Nice night out,2
Not a baseball fan,0
Go here often and always find something I need.,0
"Both stores seem to have cashiers that hate their jobs and people, as no one is ever friendly.. overpriced for the 2nd hand things they sell.",0
If you have a tight budget or just like to shop for bargains you can find everything from baby clothes to dining room furniture. During the Christmas shopping season they had a room dedicated to all things Christmas.,0
"You never know what you'll find at this store, and the people are so friendly.",0
They did a great job on my truck. They missed a few things I said to fix. But they did a great job on my tune up and ball joints. Customer service is lacking,0
Always do good work!,0
"Roger and his staff are highly qualified, excellent customer service and get your rig back on the road, clickety split! Been going to his shop for decades!! Great job, guys!",0
"I want to like this place, because the people are friendly and they mean well. I used them for years, but on several occasions I have regretted it. Oil filters not tightened. Accidentally using the most expensive synthetic. Getting a quote with one price and a bill for another. I can't do it anymore.",0
Helped me out a lot.,0
Nice facility. Friendly staff. Understaffed,0
Awsome place for those in need of assisted living.,0
Clean - friendly sta,0
I work there,2
I like this facility quite a bit.,0
What's not to like!,0
"You get what you pay for. Got a mattres there, not overly impressed. Would get something better if I could.",0
Always friendly and helpful,0
Has a lot to choose from.,0
"They've probably forgot more about nuts, bolts, and assorted fasteners than I know. They were friendly, knew what i needed, and were able to help me out. They carried more stuff than I thought they did. Will definitely be back when i need to fix my trailer, or get tire chains next winter.",0
Has it all and great people. Love this place.,0
Super knowledgeable great service friendly people,0
"Matt, the guy who works up at the front counter is awesome!",0
Usually if you go there they'll have what you need.,0
The lady helped me get a decent policy.,0
Great friendly service,2
Always knowledgeable and courteous.,0
Always helpful and excellent service,0
Was exploring via bicycle when I came across this quiet park that offered shade from the sun and a nice breeze. Nearly fell asleep,0
"Great park ! Little bit of everything. Small trail network connecting the nearby grade school play grounds , basketball court. Including several open field areas baseball field, fenced tennis courts, and a municipal covered pic and barbq area. Trash cans , doggy poop bags ensure pet owners can clean up after themselves.",0
"Lots of dogs get walked here and it's a good place for kids, it's right by a school. When right down a trail there is a Walmart, I always find myself wanting something to eat or drink. On that note a short walk will also bring you to a great place called Burger Haven.",0
"Best school in Anchorage by far. The teachers, principal, and staff are all amazing and so nice and give great greetings makes it a very comfortable place. It's like everyone is family ðŸ˜ðŸ’œ",0
"Love the park. My prob is, i walked home from a really good party.was That park my cell phone and glasses were stolen at. Use caution",0
My son loves coming to this park. He enjoys all the free space.,0
My sister goes to this so and she said she loves the school,0
Good place 2 ðŸš¶,0
Nice place for kids that are adult supervised.,0
"A nice park with tennis courts, a baseball diamond, a shelter, and playground equipment.",0
Great place to take a walk with the kids.,0
Nice clean park.,2
It's OK place to take the kids to play we had find their,0
It was peaceful,2
Nice and clean,2
"Some of the tellers are fantastic, there friendly, very prompt and know exactly what there doing & some are simply terrible at there job. There rude & have know clue what a $1bill is. Some management, wont acknowledge the wrong doing & train the employee better. Then upper management gets involved & says absolutely the employee was wrong! There is just alot of holes. But again, there are alot of great tellers , but when I'm going in & every other time is a bad experience, ðŸ¤·â™€ï¸",0
"She was nice and quick but she never went over the credit cards types with me and just chose one herself when I could of had a lower interest rate, no annual fee, and wouldn't had to put down a deposit",0
This bank forces you to provide very personal information to even deposit money into a members account. They would not allow me to deposit cash to a member without extensive information. I believe they wish to sell and advertise / spam all non members. These guys are NOT TO NE TRUSTED. They are evil.,0
After giving them a try.. meh.. felt like I only went in circles being with this place. Definitely excited to be with another bank!ðŸ™ŒðŸ½ These guys blow.,0
"The customer service is phenomenal, but what ticks me off is that the so called ""24-hour"" ATM is not what it's set out to be. It keeps on being out of service and the place is always under reinnervation! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘Ž",0
I tried getting a checking account but Samantha Berger tried to say my paycheck was too small and she automatically assumed I wanted the premium checkings account it was like she didn't know we knew about the premium and regular account and so when we were in the process of getting my account she said I needed a piece of mail containing my address even tho my boyfriend who has an account with then didn't hav to show his address so yea I give this 2 stars,0
These guys have the best customer service! And I rarely have to wait in line.,0
Would not make change for a $100 bill because I am not a member! WOW! What a stupid bank!,0
If you want to stand in line for 45 mins because they only have 2 tellers at peak time this is the bank for you.,0
"Not the best location, always busy.",0
"Every yr i love to order their tamales and share with my family, they love tamales too.mmm",0
"Definitely the best quality & value for Mexican food that I've had since moving here. You can get a nice tamale and taco combo (with rice and beans) for like $7. The burrito is a little more expensive, but you won't be paying over $10 like you would at Taco King. You can also buy ingredients and tortillas here as it is a factory that makes their own products. The only downside is that the deli is only open for lunch, otherwise I'd go back more often.",0
Love their food. U have to place your order on Thursday in order to get your food on Friday. They don't do orders on the weekends,0
"Five stars, BUT no longer serves hot food! Although you can order tamales for next day pick up.",0
Luv to buy Local and Support Local Business. .. Plus it's cheaper when you buy it from the factory that makes the products and fresher too,0
I like it.,2
What happen to the pepqper mill wow use to be amazing now it's a dump they just don't care anymore.,0
The quiet side of of the Sea Gally restaurant. Biggest salad bar in town. Sunny deck for outside dining.,0
"They have lot's of tv's, with happy hour food, great for UFC.",0
The Waiters take a long time to recognize your there. ( seat yourself) the location is quite run down and in a bad part of anchorage. Its also part of another restaurant so the bar keep is also the waiter for both sides. The food is in small portions and they seemed very suprrized that we were even there. They also gave us the menu for the other restaurant. ( there connected) the food was good but staked on a small plate so messy kids might be eating off the table (ground) due to small room to eat. Over all a place i would not eat again try naruto its good food.,0
Make sure to get the tater tot nachos or as we call them tatchos.,0
Little less obviousness next time please,0
Good food and drinks,0
My mother-in-law has to go out in the mountains off old Seward highway and pick up plants and beautiful flowers and replant them in my mom's yard and this is where we used to come and get all the fertilizer things take care of the yard and keep the grass clean the great place people are really helpful come down and see,0
Love the Christmas tree experience. Fairly priced and great service. Seven years running and each of our trees has been great!!,0
Wide variety of high quality animal care and homestead supplies. Great staff. They now carry Icebugs!,0
I get dog food and couple other odds and ends the remodle has made it a little confuseing,0
The woman at the front desk were pretty rude and condescending. Warehouse guys treated me the same.,0
Wonderful local store with lots of products!!,0
As always very professional and knowledgeable. Love the Abbot Freddys jewelry store!,0
They used to adjust watches for free and as a result this was always shopped for jewelry here first. Now they charge so I think I'll look somewhere else first next time. Plenty of other places will adjust for free.,0
Amazing staff love this place,0
Sold me fake jewelery ðŸ‘Ž,0
The new optometrist Dr. Rennard was FANTASTIC!! He made the exam so comfortable and took time to actually explain my prescription. The whole experience was great. Hedi the woman who helped me pick out frames and order lenses was very friendly and a joy to work with. You can tell she goes the extra mile with her customers because everyone who walked in knew her!! Can't recommend midtown Lens Crafters enough. Best eye exam in town hands down!!,0
Take your money elsewhere. Was not contacted when my disabled Mother's glasses came in. After leaving 3 voicemail (because you don't get to talk to anyone) didn't even get a courtesy return call. Took off work and went there to discover they had been sitting there for no one knows how long!,0
"The store was clean and well stocked, the staff was friendly and helpful and I got my glasses in record time.",0
"Dr. Rennard was very professional and informative. David, who helped me with my glasses, was extremely kind and personable. I will definitely recommend this office to my friends.",0
Everything went well even the eye exam and a variety of glasses,0
"This optometry is a place to get your eyeexam, the service is fast and the staff is awesome in customer service. You will be happy when you leave with a brand new pair of glasses, not only that they have shown that they care and has helped my daughter and self with a pair glasses. We are so grateful for your help. Thank you so much",0
"This review is not a reflection of the eye doctors just the actual business LENSCRAPTERS. Blatant insurance fraud, Zero prescription $176 Oakley sunglasses were billed out as $176+$270 for lenses, but my insurance would cover everything but $100. What planet does a pair of non prescription Oakley sunglasses cost $400+. My wife's $86 glasses somehow magically had $300 lenses attached. Just another company trying to abuse insurance.",0
"The staff here is amazing--so helpful and courteous! By far one of the best LensCrafters stores I've been to, and I've been buying glasses here for years.",0
Been coming here for years now great place definitly great friendly workers Dr lan is great,0
very nice trails. i enjoy cross country skiing at hillside and hilltop,0
Several easy hikes originate here. Also a great spot for beginning to intermediate cross country bicycling. Convenient access from north or east Anchorage.,0
A great place to walk your dog,0
"So many trails to hike, bike or dog walk. Great place to to just go out onto the woods and explore. I highly recommend exploring all of Far North Bicentennial Park.",0
"Great place to start a ski or bike. I haven't heard of much theft lately, but North parking lot may be safer.",0
"Love, love, love hiking the Campbell Creek trail system. First few times I got turned around (so many trails) so allow extra time until you figure out the lay of the land if you are going off the main trail. So many options- uphill, around the lakes (across in winter), ties into Hillside trail system and JBER (need recreation pass), and on downtown to Tony Knowles. Used by foot, bike and skiers.",0
Absolutely amazing! Very peaceful!,0
Excellent trail that leads up to some awesome downhill singletracks. We are truly privileged to have access to such amazing trails right in town.,0
Like the jungle,2
Not real busy but friendly and efficient. Got in got done got out.,0
"Efficient, went right in with my appointment. Hard to find with construction. It's inside the mall, but you have to use the side door.",0
"Wonderful customer service, make sure to make an appointment online and you'll be in and out in no time.",0
Make an appointment it faster than a walk in.,0
Good place to go for hazmat for dmv the lady who helped me was very accommodating as i showed up 10 min before closing,0

Fast service. Brought my computer back to life.,0
Loved it. Very helpful. Like a king taking care of people in need,0
"Glenn was super helpful. He opened up shop for me on Father's Day so I could get a part to finish my computer repair. He was very helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. Prices are very competitive and his work is right the first time. I will use Comptronics for all my repair needs in the future and recommend you do also.",0
Was thinking I would have to run to Anchorage to get some small hard to find electronic parts but was pleased Glenn was open on Saturday and had these parts. It is getting hard to find local retailers with hard to find items in stock.,0
Glen had a part for a TV nobody else had in town. Want great customer service go see him.,0
Just dropped off my vhs/dvd player this morning for repairs. It was fixed and I have it back all ready! The parts were in Stock and they are very knowledgeable.,0
Wife likes their stuff,0
"This is a terrible business, overcharges and continuing complaints for services not rendered.",0
"Work done on my VCR/DVD was inadequate. VCR did work some what before I placed it in the shop, however, it does not work at all now.",0
Very resourceful but spendy,0

Modern facilities. Friendly and helpful staff. Excellently maintained basketball court! Wonderful all around!,0
Great location. Great facility. We went swimming for Tiny Waves five and under. My toddler loved it. They do a lot gym during the school year along with lots of classes. They do not have a family membership. My 2 year old costs the same as me to go swimming.,0
"Recreational center for swimming, soccer, basketball, roller skating and exercises.",0
Fun pool...could be warmer,0
"Workers are really nice, pool is clean.",0
Best facility for the family!!,0

Great coffee and great service! I also really love how cute they made the hot chocolates that I ordered for my kids â¤,0
Ladys are the best coffee amazing and food great,0
"Always great service and coffee, along with excellent sides. Highly recommend",0
"Competent, quick service, better prices than other coffee shops in the immediate area. Good hot chocolates. Not optimal for walk-ups, but if you're in a car, on the go, this is a good place to hit-up on West End.",0
"Always good quick service, but as a barista myself I find mostly inexperienced baristas. Drive through atmosphere.",0
Best coffee in town. Try a strawberry smoothie with lime.,0

Delicious beef soft tacos! Love the nachos but my family didn't help me eat it as much as I thought they would. Next time I'll order 3 soft beef tacos and a side of beans or rice.,0
Had enchiladas and tacos so delicious highly recommend this place.,0
Amazing truly authentic mexican food,0
Great and authentic Mexican food.,0
Best tacos in town.,0
"Great Food, Great Prices, Great service, All Around Great People, and perfect shack for a family lunch out(:",0
Way good food and very fair portions. Great lunch spot!,0
This is one ofnths best Mexican restaurantfood places we have in Ketchikan they have been around for years and are awesome chefs,0
Tasty and made to order.,0
Great food nice people!!,0
Not great but the best Mexican food in town. Mild fresno style,0
"This is a pretty good place to go let off some steam. Its the only course that has not kicked me off for hitting the golf ball like Adam Sandler, in that one movie. Nice driving range and very nice chipping/putting green. The only thing that sucks is well, with golf comes a drink on or off the course. And olny drinks are for the kids, lol. All and all 4 out of 5 star's",0
Good spot if they would only get like the bowling alleyhas there Neon bowl and go with or try it out. I mean think about it might be fun for all.,0
"Nice and challenging holes. Plus if your renting the equipment, not too expensive.",0
Awesome place for a nice day of golf,0
Nice driving range and full course. Beautiful,0
Very good they are making nice course,0
I love this course,0
Just had to park never played,0
Checkout my youtube channel ALASKA FISH HUNTER,0
"Canâ€™t beat the view, the friendly staff and the new â€œHunger Bunkerâ€ and â€œRoadhouseâ€ for some amazing food and coffee bar. My daughter loves it too! If you havenâ€™t played here yet, itâ€™s a must!",0
Nice atmosphere and they have done a lot of work on the course. Nicely done guy and gals.,0
Greens are good course is beautiful and I like the new snack shack,0
The scenery is unbeatable and the course offers a fantastic experience. It is even good for beginners. I am looking forward to playing there again.,0
Par 3 course so no need to bring your driver. With holes on top of one another you got to watch out cuz not all can be tiger tiger Cory,0
"Small part 27 course that is inexpensive, and great for short game practice. Great views, with even a creek running through hole six. We play at least once a week.",0
Love the peaceful walk and great scenery. Really peaceful and the owner is great.,0
Par 3 course. VERY challenging greens if your short game needs work. Practice here. Problem is... cost the same as other 9 hole courses and half the holes you drive off of astroturf. That creek shot is fun though.,0
Sleepy Hollow is a great par 3 course in an awesome Alaska setting. I've never had a bad round of golf there.,0
Better than settlers Bay,0
"Great space and friendly space. Convertible as a convention center should be. Nice, open feel.",0
"Excellent building for an event or convention. The Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center (Dena'ina Center) is located in the Downtown Anchorage, so you'll most likely need to park in a garage. There are many restaurants in the area, so get a bite to eat and cheap drink then head inside. If the event or convention is on the first floor remember restrooms are also on the second floor if you can get to them. The views from outside are amazing and you should try to go all the way up to the top floor to view the Downtown area. The sound here is ok, but when they have events in multiple rooms I'm impressed I don't hear anything from the other rooms.",0
"NW Cannabis Cup, 2015 Anchorage, Alaska Alaska's Inaugural Cannabis TRADESHOW/COMPETITION/EDUCATION EVENT @ THE DENAINA CENTER May 16-17 2015",0
the guy inside the convention center had a problem with me getting water from the fountain,0
"A downtown prison for one. I understand that Star is a local celebrity but find them a more suitable place to live- Alaska Zoo, Reindeer Farm, AWCC, RRR, etc. This prison in downtown does not have the space recommended for this species to thrive.",0
I visit star anytime I'm walkin by her enclosure!!,0
"As much as Alaska presents itself as wildlife friendly, this disturbs me. If you want to see Reindeer, take a short drive to Palmer and see Reindeer in a pasture where they belong. They also have a separate pen they bring calm Reindeer into so you can interact with them. There are also bison, moose, elk and other animals. This poor animal should be out in a meadow, not in a cage.",0
Kinda funny. Basically someone's pet in the middle of downtown. His cage and attached barn seem adequate and not too sad a life. This is NOT a tourist destination. It's a fun spot to walk by if you're in the area or have kids.,0
love it the reigndeer is so cute and so close to town,0
"Reindeer was shy when we walked by but could see him thru the fence. Donner, Blitzen maybe",0
Randomly discovered Star when driving downtown. Looked rather sad when visiting,0
Really nice to see a reindeer for free,0
"Wide variety of office supplies, great staff. Rob is very knowledgeable.",0
"Overpriced office supplies acting somewhat like a monopoly. However, they have excellent employees and a good service department for copier repair. If they could offer competitive pricing they would dominate.",0
This is the best place in town to buy your business items for you office and has been locally owned forbears and always had managed to stay up with the technology and generations that came out new every hear always made sure we had it and were up to date. They have the best customer service and helping staff in this business classement,0
Helpful advice and tips for any project.,0
Great knowledgeable staff.,2

"It's Starbucks bradda, delicious way to get 'er goin. Try it.",0
Very nice staff.. great coffee.. in Ketchikan..,0
I go there twice a month very convenient,0
Only Starbucks in town located inside Safeway. Same great cup of coffee you would get at a Starbucks down south!,0
"Amazing staff, always know my drink, always smiling! Best coffee shop in town",0
Always the best and quickest coffee in town,0
hard for workers to get the order right,0
Damn good coffe,2
Not the biggest fan of starbucks for the price,0
COFFEE AND FOOD,2
I like Dr Chad a lot. But not sure if I get what I expect out of the adjustments. Sometimes I feel good right away and it lasts quite awhile other times I feel ok within a few days but then fades really quick. Right now I'm in the latter stage. Can't afford to keep going back when it doesn't work so I'm suffering through till I can afford a visit.,0
Doctor Chad and staff go out of their way to make you comfortable. You're always greeted with a smile.,0
"Loved the groupon, the 60 minute medical massage was incredible. Dr. Chad was very friendly and the adjustments were fabulous.",0
"I had great experiences at Anchorage Spinal Care. The front desk, medical support staff, doctor, and massage therapist were all top notch. There isn't a single thing they could have done do impress me more. The doctor was thorough, direct, and patient. The massage therapist was the best I've ever experienced and did an incredible job of finding and focusing on the trouble areas. I know where I'm spending my deductible next year.",0
"The team at Anchorage Spinal Care is amazing! Used a groupon initially, and have continued going back. Very knowledgeable and friendly. You will not be disappointed!",0
Wish I could afford to go here. They're super nice and caring and they do have really great prices! Love the office manager she's great!,0
"Absolutely recommend to any of my friends, family and co-workers. They have helped me with chronic back pain.",0
Great staff and service i wont go anywhere else,0
They are super friendly and great with families with little ones,0
Everyone there are so helpful & friendly. They really care!,0
"Great place, thanks for good massage!!",0
Chiropractic care has relieved my back pain. And the staff are very nice.,0
"Spendy, but the massage was nice.",0
"Simple and Good place to go for quality products. Due to organic quality, the products will be more expensive then you are used to buying at.",0
This is my go to spot in the big A. It's a 20 minute walk from the VA hospital. This Place is always clean. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Oh and the atm only charges a 1.00 fee.,0
"Always great products and excellent staff. My go to spot in Muldoon. Plus tonight my budtender was so helpful in testing my cartridge and new battery for me, thank you so much.",0
Only been there once but I totally loved it! Clean with super nice employees!,0
The staff are very patient and listen to all questions and have the answers unless they too themselves are still learning about products,0
The best by far.,0
There just starting but what a spot for sure. And the hidden gem is the food truck. If you want some of the best food I've ever had in my life . Trucks name Kings of the Mountain. And If you can bring an appetite you won't be disappointed.,0
"It's new, there's a lift, that's about it. I'm sure other amenities will follow. Great addition to the area. I don't know what the lift fees are. Seems like if you have a buddy who can drive ya up the hill a few miles, you can ski down for free on some groomed trails in the same general area.",0
"Overall a great experience. Runs are great. Only downside is the lift lines are very very slow, like 20 minute waits.",0
Great place for valley family's. Small and quaint,0
Food was perfect and well the ski side was nice to see up there very clean and so very much could happen. I cant wait to see what or where the owners go . Sky's the limit. Hope to be up there soon again,0
Beautiful place to stop for some photos.,0
So great to have this available to us!,0
Sick hill for kids,0
I called up asking for sour cream Patty answer the phone and said we usually have it but I don't know if we have it today and I was like what can you look she told me no and I was like that doesn't really help me very poor customer service then I called back and asked for the manager and she told me she was the manager not a good look.,0
They had my prescription ready within 30 minutes of my doctor sending it to them during rush hour! There was a little issue with my insurance not going through and they fixed it for me in a jiff. Just awesome!,0
"Store is always very clean, which I like. Also they have a pleasant place to sit back by the pharmacy if you come with a walk in prescription. Front of store checkout is good most of the time but can be slow or even completely unmanned occasionally. The pharmacists are nice, but I have several prescriptions and sometimes one is ready and another is not because they are unable to figure out my refill schedule, causing me to make multiple trips back to get all my meds. They just shortened the pharmacy hours, which I am also not happy about. My only other criticism is regarding the phone reminders. The automated system is relentless, sometimes calling me multiple times a day to come pick up my meds.",0
Pricy! But convenient.,2
Rude worthless service that could not handle the simplest tasks that every other Walgreens can do.,0
Passport pictures that were taken here were sent back (they edited the background). Heard from another customer that the same thing had happened to her (she said hers were the wrong size).,0
"Nice, clean store",2
Very professional. Nice shop set up. Good social distancing. Friendly staff. I enjoyed the joints we bought. Decent prices for Anchorage,0
The best closest place to my home right across from bingo Hall so convienant if u a bingo player staff is friendly and knowledgeable plus they have eye candy ðŸ˜› dude with all the tatts,0

Very nice people as always. ðŸ˜€,0

"Good sales team. Honest, straight forward. Overall good guys",0
Trustworthy & friendly staff. Great place to pick up an affordable used vehicle!,0
I couldn't have been more satisfied with my car buying experience. The owner has a sincere interest in your satisfaction and the entire team goes out of their way to make sure you're happy. My 2012 Ford Fusion is a beauty! It's a smooth ride and the couple little issues I had were completely taken care of by DCC. Thank you guys so much!! I will definitely send people your way when they're looking for a new ride!,0
I bought a 2011 Chevy Traverse from them. I live on the Kenai Peninsula. I got car home and had problems with the vehicle. Delta Car Conection helped me with the problems. I recommend this place for GREAT Service and GREAT people.,0
"An excellent place to buy a car! My daughter got the car that she wanted, and it was easy as pie :-) absolutely no pressure, which was one of the things that brought us back after trying other cars that other Lots. Thank you! My daughter is absolutely loving her first car!",0
These guys are crooks. They told me I could take my deposit back cause I love out of area. The weekend I was going to go get the car. I lost my job and requested my deposit back. They straight up told me that this was always a non refundable deposit. They lie and this was by far the worse experience I ever encountered with a car company and I am pretty easy going person. They literally just jacked 500 dollars from me. I suggest you shop elsewhere. Happy holidays everyone,0
Delta listed truck on Craigslist as having 20k less mileage than actual mileage on vehicle. That kind of misrepresentation does not earn my trust or respect. Waste of time. Edit: Response to the owner- Are you downplaying the misrepresentation since the truck already had 200k? That doesn't make it justifiable. Please note I directly informed Russell of the discrepancy upon discovery. I promptly turned the truck off and handed back the keys. Still a waste of time.,0
Highly recommend! Great customer service and super friendly! Won't try to push any cars on you! Pedro is amazing!! Thank you!!,0
I been doing business with him since last year and when is time for me to look for a car. Delta Car Connection is the place. Thanks Pedro for the great help you provided to me.,0
Best cars in Anchorage,0
There here for you look around ask questions have fun...,0

Bought my car from them 4 months ago still runs perfect l love my pontiac and i brought my brother there this week and he bought a pontiac too! Would recommend them to anyone and i will be buying my next vehicle from them.,0
"Very helpful with getting the car you want and or need here in Anchorage, Alaska",0
"These folks are amazing! Our gym needed new handles for our battle ropes and nobody else would touch them! Rob didn't hesitate! Even though the job was way out of their normal scope, he told us he'd take care of it! There's been great communication and he's paid close attention to what we needed, even ordering special materials and testing them to make sure they'd hold up through the extensive use we're going to put them through! We don't even have a boat! The best type of people work here so go! If you go somewhere else you're going to miss out!",0
"Better itemize service, communication is key. Talented staff techs. Expect to pay 155 per hour for everything.",0
Great service. Very knowledgeable.,0

Awesome frozen yogurt love taking my kids here!,0
Drove mom 50 miles for,0
"It's a relaxed, noninvasive experience there. They ask once if you need help finding anything and offer advice when you ask and that one girl working there, used to follow people around the entire time, is gone it's so much better. Great variety but the prices are high. Online is wayyyy cheaper. Great service and customer service skills though",0
Love the 5/20$ panties short version I am addicted to them,0
Staff here are always welcoming and very knowledgeable with the products. Keep up the great service!,0
They have everything you need and everyone is super helpful to help you navigate if it's your first time or a regular customer.,0
They need to make up their mind on the mask rules. One day they don't require the next day they do. The joke is on them. I'll go online and not spend my money there again.,0
Very Friendly Staff and informative of store products,0
"Staff are wonderful, very helpful and informative.",0
Great customer service.,2
Love love love is all I can say.... ;),0
"Homey atmosphere, meat cooked so tender you can cut it with a spoon, cornbread to die for, sides so good you want to ask for more. This small local business is friendly and welcoming and if you eat on the deck the view of the lake is wholesome and relaxing. Great place to visit!",0
Their food is amazing! Best southern BBQ in town! Prices are amazing and they have awesome owners!. They have the best loaded potato salad! The views are amazing!,0
Nice staff. Great good.,0
Must go place to eat. Good downhome cookin,0
friendly employees and great food.,0
Best BBQ I've ever had,0
Excellent BBQ in a homestyle restaurant.,0
I like it,2
"Visited to look for a decent entry level hard tail bike and made a mistake. Nobody said a word to me when I walked in, no greetings, no offers for help or anything. It looks like they specialize in high end bikes here and I'm somehow glad I wasn't helped, otherwise, I probably would've been laughed at or got sent to Walmart. The store looked clean though and it seems like the employees are knowledgeable from overhearing one talking to a client.",0
Friendly staff. Nice and clean shop. Knowledgeable maintenance crew. Prices are definitely higher than like products at other shops.,0
"Great bike shop, folks are very helpful. In and out quickly with exactly what I needed.",0
"Love this shop. Knowledgeable, so helpful, very reasonably priced. Often they can do a small job the same day (of course depending how busy they are). Many local brands and items. Always friendly.",0
"Clean store and bike service in a repurposed fire station with friendly, knowledgeable staff. Specialize in 907 bikes.",0
Great place and great service!,0
Great customer service and gear!,0
"I purchased a fat bike from Chain Reaction a few weeks ago and was very pleased with the experience. The staff was very knowledgeable and helped me find a great bike to fit my budget, instead of just pointing me towards something more expensive. I will definitely be going back to Chain Reaction Cycles in the future and recommending friends in the meantime.",0
"The service is very personalized and the mechanics are always there to immediately diagnose the problem. I purchased three bikes, two Santa Cruz bikes and a 907 Snow and I instantly fell in love with the perfect geometry and riding smoothness of the Santa Cruz machines. I ride my Santa Cruz near daily and what I love most about it is its consistency and predictability. The owners ride these bikes too and you are very likely to see them on the trails on any given day. I have never really enjoyed biking until I bought a Santa Cruz. Check these guys out you won't be sorry.",0
"Excellent, fast, affordable and friendly. Not a single bit of snark for being an overweight rider bringing in a cheap bike.",0
"Visited out of curiosity, the store looked good, will return to examine the store more closely.",0
"They have good stuff. The tech's are knowledgeable. Not the fastest turn around, but quality work.",0
Great bikes and customer service.,0
"The shop has great guys that are willing to listen you your needs. I am super cheap when it comes to bikes, and they always help me out irregardless if they sell me something.",0
"I called to get some beta on the best local mountain biking in and around Anchorage. I've only been here for a few months and just wanted to ask someone where to get good info. I had just called another bike shop few minutes before and they were rude, short, and totally unhelpful. They made it apparent that I was wasting their time. When Chain Reaction answered they were friendly, helpful, and totally steered me in the right direction. I'm planning on upgrading to a full-suspension bike this year-- I'll be sure to give Chain Reaction my business. Some bike shops donâ€™t understand customer service or community development. They should revisit the basics of owning a business. Thanks for the help Chain Reaction.",0
Prices are way way up there too much for ordinary joe,0
Best bicycle shop in Anchorage.,0
"Knowledgeable staff, great products, clean and bright store!",0
They have moved,2
Didn't have to wait long and had no issues either way.,0
"Very friendly small business that only runs in the summer. The car we got was definitely older and had a bunch of miles on it, but it drove well and we felt confident in it getting us from Anchorage to Seward and back. Rates were very reasonable",0
"The best combination of security, price and service I've found in Anchorage. Shuttle to/from airport is quick. Vehicle is warmed up prior to your arrival at lot for pickup. My new 'go to' for long term parking in ANC.",0
Our car was safe here at a decent rate. Covered in a foot of snow when we got back but they helped us clean it off while we got the car seats loaded up.,0
These are great people and their customer service is above and beyond.,0
Great prices and personality.,0
Decent price with airport shuttle service.,0
"Parking is OK, but I would avoid it due to expense and traffic patterns",0
"Cheap, secure parking",2
"Nice little bar tucked in the alley, bright, good music and vibes, friendly staff. Open space, but not too crowded.",0
"Great little bar if you're with a small group and just want a quieter place to hangout. There's darts and a Foosball table, along with some interesting artwork decorating the walls. Never had a bad time here.",0
Marika (probably spelled wrong) is super sweet! Just wants you to have a good time,0
"Great place to have a few drinks , visit with friends and just relax .",0
Great location & free WiFi.,0
Ketchikan's best kept secret bar,0
As if they need my 5 star review. This place rocks. I love the commentary gift wrapping. They have the greatest assortment of quality items. I do almost all of my gist shopping here now. I love just browsing what cool new things have arrived too.,0
Spendy but lovely items for sale.,0
"I love this place, but they are spendy.",0
Such a cute shop ! Lots of gift ideas & adorableness !,0
"Wow, do I love this store! There's a little bit of everything. Cooking/baking supplies, home decor, toys, etc. Everthing is great quality, perhaps on the spendy side for some things but overall worth the money.",0
"This is a cute store with a lot of great kitchen goods. If you need something different for a cook in your life -- or if you want something for yourself (try the Bellini Jam, it rocked my world) -- then this is your place. Recipe books, tea and related paraphernalia, home bar-ware, kettles, utensils, snacks, spreads, you name it, they are your best chance to find it on this island. The other half of the store is some toys for kids and some linens and so forth. I usually don't make it that far before I max out my budget, though...",0
Great shop with fun odds and ends but be prepared to spend a pretty fortune as this is more of a boutique.,0
Great shop. Always has new and unique items.,0
"Love it, so many wonderful treasures!",0
"Simply Bella has wonderfully unique and awesome products, everything you can think of for the kitchen, bathroom and home and they also carry cool baby clothes and toys as well as stationary and journals. Great place to go for gifts for special people in your life. My boyfriend and I love to go there and peruse around and usually are treated very well. I'm giving it four stars this time due to the service we receive today. I found a journal that I loved and since my Birthday is in May I was taking a picture of it to show my boyfriend to give him an idea of a present. As I was taking the picture a blonde woman came up to me and asked if I needed help and I told her no. My boyfriend, told me later, that he witnessed her go directly to the counter where I guess she told all her coworkers that I was doing something wrong because he said they were all glaring at me. She was the one who checked us out and she threw his credit card back at him after she swiped it and he had bought over $60 worth of stuff. I really loved going hear before this incident but now I unfortunately have a different view of it.",0
Always have a good time looking at everything!,0
"I love buying things there, so awesome",0
Lots of neat stuff ðŸ˜Š,0
"The things they have in this store are amazing. A little on the spendy side, but good quality.",0
Very unique gifts for women and household items.,0
Great hard to find items you can't get anywhere else in Ketchikan,0
Good place to find great stuff,0
Great place to shop,0
So many treasures waiting to be found!,0
Love it here!,2
Not particularly cheap but that's what you should expect where it is. They carry allot of different things. Sort of a 1 stop shop. People here are super friendly.,0
"This is a great little grocery store. They almost always have what I need. They have lots of other stuff besides groceries, as well. The staff is always friendly and helpful. They accept credit cards, WIC and cash.",0
Clean and well organized. They have friendly staff and they are trained well. Their prices are high but it's expected with their location.,0
"M&M Market is Great. Especially since it is 15 miles to get groceries otherwise. Great employees too, always helpful and happy.",0
"Well what can I say..... It's a little store in a small community. Prices are higher than in town, mostly because they resell bulk items bought from other stores in town. Staff is plesent & helpfull, owner is a little short sometimes but is still friendly. Best item I found is Midnight Special tobacco which is priced lower than in town (Kenai).",0
Good store if your out north and don't want to drive to town.meat is fresh and good cuts only.,0
Well stocked and very friendly staff. You can't beat this place for the convenience.,0
The ladies who work there are very nice,0
"Very friendly people, nice environment.Clean store",0
Wonderful little grocery store,0
Great little mom and pop store,0
How do they sleep at night high prices I have to be desperate to shop in that store..so much for supporting the locals,0
Convenient and friendly but very expensive to shop,0
Love the people amazing service,0

Expensive but convenient,2
For such a small town they have your basics and a bit more,0
Kinda expensive but great when in need,0
Prices r a little high,0
What are you looking for? Yea they got that,0
Local and good,2
Small town store,2
Fun a nice walk on a beautiful day. The trail down to the beach is a bit steep.,0
Lovely trail from Old Town Kenai (near Veronicas) to the beach.,0
I go all the time when I'm in Kenai. Please keep your dogs on a leash is a requirement...thankyou,0
"Had fun, just wondered around trying to find the trails etc.",0
Great trail. Going from the beach below right up to the high class campground i just reveiwed lol. Was actially a pleasent place to reach further towards being enlightened i hope. Cause damn im run down and exhausted amd..yeah l..o...l.,0
"I love walking on the beach, and sunrise and sunset r beautiful.",0
"Beautiful short, but fairly steep trail to and from the Kenai beach",0

They replaced the 2 items I had ordered the day before with no problems.,0
"Good pizza and you can grab it to go. Customer service is good, they are polite and friendly. Pizza is average, not the worst, not the best. It isn't super greasy like Sicily's so that's a plus... But they don't offer stuffed crust like Little Ceasar does... If they had that stuffed crust on menu this would be 5 stars easy!",0
These guys are awesome all around. Tikahtnu location is awesome as well! Always service with a smile and perfect for the family budget! Good job guys!,0
"Very tasty, sort of New York Style Pizza. Staff was friendly and fast",0
"Friendly costumer service, good food.",0
Local equivalent of little cesears... Love their customer appreciation day 5buck pizzas,0
"My Husband is a patient there, and they take such good care of him! They are all amazing with me when I call them to talk about my husband! So happy that I found a good place for my husband to go to!",0
"Iâ€™d give no stars if I could. Hereâ€™s how my visit went: â€œOh, youâ€™re suffering, that will be $300+.â€ â€œWeâ€™ll run labs and come up with a treatment plan.â€ 2 months go by... Crickets. â€œOh, you want a treatment plan? $300 more dollars.â€ I hope you guys burn in hell.",0
Kristina and Dr. Nalbandian are the best. Very good at what they do!,0
"We had been looking for a doctor who leaned towards natural medicine for our ADHD daughter, and wow is Dr. Jen wonderful! The staff does their job. The office is spotless and well-decorated (I totally wanted to steal some of their magazines!!). But I canâ€™t say enough about how good Dr. Jen and Leann are with the kiddos. However. Take you needle-frightened kiddo somewhere else to do blood draws - the phlebotomist has zero patience for scared children.",0
"Had mono twice in one year, received great care at here. Everyone is really caring and takes their time. Love this place!!",0
"I was feeling very frustrated, but am updating my prior review because after sending the message through the portal directly to the doctor I received a call and we have gotten things sorted out. I received the call this evening after leaving the email with her a little before noon. My daughter has been sick for 5 months and we have been in and out of traditional doctors offices. We went here and had a 2 hour consultation with the doctor. I felt really good about things when I left, but then found out the test she ordered can't be done on children. I called back several times. I have left 6 voice messages and 1 message through their patient portal in the last week and a half, but no one has responded to me.",0
"My wife received a referral last Fall for a skin issue. The doctor was completely unaware why she was there, and this was coming from another doctor that was supposedly a friend. You would have thought that they communicated about the case, but...apparently not.",0
"Kiki is the best! I've never run into any problems like the other complainers have. They must be regular complainers, or they can't manage their care effectively. Love this place",0
I love going to Avante...they take pride in patient care and are always willing to accommodate... simply the best....,0
"Scheduled an appointment, went in and they basically told me things I already had knowledge of from previous conventional doctors. Paid over $700 for nothing.",0
'll was treated a lot better this time around.,0
"I was visiting for the past two week from Virginia Beach and happened to stop by, Iâ€™m glad I did. I met some awesome folks, including Steve! He was so friendly, personable and accommodating. The Raven will be my go to location for a drink without a doubt if ever I am back in town. Thank you Steve for being so awesome!",0
Very friendly bartenders and they have great gatherings there.,0
"I don't realy dislike this place. I enjoy it actualy. However the bar tenders make the drinks too hard, and I feel they are untrained at mixing drinks. I can order the same drink from the same bar tender and it's always different in flavor and in alcohol content.",0
Nice crowd of people. Little drinks. They dont accept credit cards. Got a drink paid for so i ordered a fireball cinnamon rum. Even though last sunday they ran out of the ingredients for pina colada. They notice when i go there,0
"Love the neighborhood hangout. Think the Eagle, but... Alaskan?",0
"Relaxed atmosphere, no cover charge, friendly bartenders.",0
"my favorite bar in town. the tenders are amazing, the prices are perfect, the crowd is wonderful.",0
"A very low-key spot to go and drink. Has more the traditional bar atmosphere, barkeep and darts.",0
Casual bear bar,2
"Who doesn't love Pizza Hut's pan crust! We go for the lunch buffet where you get pizza, bread sticks, pasta, dessert sticks, salad, and soda for $9. They are great about taking ""special"" requests for favorite pizzas to put out on the buffet line. Their salad bar variety isn't great, but it's a pretty decent salad for $9.",0
The place seems ancient and has a weird smell. The employees are nice and it's Pizza Hut so you know what you're getting.,0
"Great all you can eat lunch buffet. Friendly, smiling employees.",0
Everyone had to wait for 25 minutes for a couple handfuls of chicken on the buffet.ðŸ‘Ž,0
"horrible experience, lost my order was treated like crap when I asked about my food. Taking my pizza orders elsewhere",0
Slow place was empty.,0
"Very Professional Operation. Tommy P. was our guide for the 3 hour tour. We were given instructions on how to operate the ATVs as each was a little different. Then he took us down by the river on a short course so we could become comfortable always checking on us and giving us local history. Thereafter, we crossed the road and really did some off-roading! Up hills, through valleys, and even played in the mud a little. Multiple moose sightings and sweeping views of the mountains and glacier. All-in-all it was a great experience and would recommend to friends. Also... there's a little espresso hut on site for coffee and little snacks.",0
"If you ever traveling to Alaska this is just North of Anchorage a ways off the beaten path and it's a must-see and the guides are very knowledgeable. Pricing was good and they have zip ziplining, four wheeler guided tours and much more to offer.",0
Great tour & views. Well worth the experience,0
"Very nice guides, good service. Was great!",0
Always awesome. Same friendly faces. Family owned.,0
This new owner sure sets a good vibe when she is there.,0
One of the only two shops I'll go to in town. With fair prices and family friendly (no bikinis or half naked baristas) they've got talent and skill in making consistently good coffee across all staff. They know my order and can move through a line twice as fast as any other establishment without skimping on the quality or personable customer service. Love them!,0
"For on the go stay , this place is open!",0
Coffee made to order!,0
Great coffee and service,0
"While it makes sense that Alaska would have many great options when it comes to purchasing outdoor gear, to have a store with such varied inventory and with so many quality brands to choose from, right in the neighborhood, is fantastic! I am glad to be able to support the friendly folks at All Seasons Clothing Company, and other stores like it, to help ensure that Alaskans have great choices that they can take home with them the same day. Having the ability to order online is very convenient, but being able to drive around the corner for specialized hiking boots, winter gear or a patch kit for my down jacket is better! If you are in the Eagle River area, it is worth making a stop.",0
Great customer service. High quality products that I'm confident will last years. Love the research pants I just got!,0
Great store! Nice variety of products. I recommend visiting them.,0
Always clean and organized. Very easy to shop.,0
What's a fantastic store. Such a friendly atmosphere. If you love the outdoors or even need some clothes for work this is the place to go no doubt. The Carhartt store for sure,0
"I came here looking for my first pair of proper winter boots. The gentleman in attendance was extremely helpful. I have wide feet, and have difficulty finding any footwear. He helped me try a few boots based on my likely use (day-to-day vs frequent outdoor work vs hiking, etc.) and let me try a number of insoles when absolutely nothing fit quite right. (This is common for me.) I was reassured that so long as I hadn't worn them outdoors, I would be able to return them if the fit didn't improve with thicker socks. (I had white socks on at the time.) Fortunately, thicker socks did the trick.",0
Good place to go if you're going to be spending some time in the cold and you need some good gear.,0
All they had was womens stuff.,0
They usually have what you need or can order it for you . A great local gun store...,0
Old Alaska take it for what you will..,0
"Had been recommended by a salesman at Bass pro since they didn't have the weapon I was looking for. I told them the firearm I was interested in and immediately saw their price was $100 more than Alaska custom firearms. I let them know this and asked if they wanted to be competitive with their price to make a sale and he responded with ""then why aren't you over there?"" Good point sir! But I'm on my way over there now, couldn't leave the parking lot without writing this review first.",0
I would patronize another store before Great Northern Guns their staff should be in a different line of work . With that said I'd rather pay more elsewhere than ever stop in there again.,0
"Awesome and helpful staff, and they have a store cat! Very cool",0
First class gun shop. Knowledgeable and friendly staff,0
Shopped for 20 years.,0
All the employees are very knowledgable and helpful,0
"So while everybody else in town has raised their prices on ammunition to something crazy.... these guys HAVEN'T , and because of that I will make sure I check these guys first when I'm looking for something from now on. THANK YOU",0
Classic gun shop,2
"Great dugouts, great food served during games, good bathrooms!",0
"Great lots of room,4 parking and kids",0
"Real bathrooms, instead of the available Porta potty, would change my rating to a 5.",0
Nice clean Field's,2
"It's a kids baseball complex, so.....",0
"Awesome staff, very friendly and professional. Answered all my questions. They even called to check up on me and make sure I had no problems. And helped me schedule my next appointment for additional work needed. I went back for a cleaning and it went very well, no post pain or discomfort.",0
"The staff is exceptional providing exemplary customer service. The ability for them to accommodate quick appointment requests is outstanding. I was experiencing severe tooth pain and the front counter customer service representative Michelle was able to promptly assist in providing me an appointment. I was seen by Dr. Oudin, who expertly reviewed my tooth pain and then provided several options ensuring cost effectiveness was a consideration for the patient. The whole experience is by far the best service you can find. All patrons are treated exceptionally well with courteousness and a smile being always willing to assist.",0
I had the best experience here... I also brought my son for his first wellness check... They were so good with him... Highly recommended.,0
"From my very first visit at the office, I was made to feel welcome and comfortable both by the friendly competence of the staff and the pleasant environment of the office itself. They took the time to explain every procedure prior to doing it and made sure any questions I had were answered. I am always given a detailed print out of the cost for any upcoming procedure/dental work that may be needed. Which helps me to budget my expenses to make sure I am able to go back if needed. They have this amazing way of making me less guilty about my flossing and brushing habits by explaining why each is important. It encourages me to want to have better oral hygiene habits so I can shock them at my next visit! If you are one who avoids the dentist, for whatever reason. Please know that there is nothing you have that they have not seen already. They are in the profession they are in to help you.",0
"Great experience, would recommend to anyone that is in search of excellent dental care services.",0
"They let you make payments. Fairly friendly. They do change what they say from time to time. Was told I could get a crown, now they say I have to have a root canal or get the tooth pulled. ðŸ˜• * Update: my tooth is doing better then they expected, I even went to their office. They were shocked. I still have my messed up tooth, with my temporary filling. they did a great job with their temp fix. They still have fair pricing and let you make payments. Way better then the crazy owner of Astentic Family dentisty, who called and harassed me(I ended up calling the cops on him, yes it was that bad!).",0
Very kind and friendly people here. It is never exciting to go to the dentist but ACD has a very friendly atmosphere and it is always a pleasure to come here.The people in this place are top notch. The x ray specialist was the fastest ever and had a great conversation (when my mouth wasn't full of dental equipment :) with the hygenist. Makes me look forward to my next appointment!,0
"This dentist office is top notch. The staff is awesome. They are friendly, funny and accommodate to the patients needs.",0
I was in and out in good time; not great fun but a good experience. Looking forward to the next appointment.,0
"Good atmosphere, caring people,",0
Everyone was kind and explained everything clearly.,0
"Wow. SO extremely disappointed with Summit Windows and Doors. Used them once before for a simple project (and cheap) to replace a wood window sill and had no issues. Flash forward a year later and we went to replace EVERY door in our home. We ordered and PAID IN FULL in September. Doors came in mid-October. Summit couldn't organize a date for drop off of my old doors. I checked on weekly to see when their shop could get me in. I kept getting the run around on why they couldn't fulfill their obligations. By mid-November I was getting a bit aggravated. I continued weekly communication with them and never got any date offerings AT ALL. Without them being to fulfill their obligation to Run and Match and deliver, I just decided to take my doors as is and fix them myself. Come to find out that they didn't have all my special ordered doors in stock. To sum up, Summit uses their ""lead times"" to buffer their mismanagement of time resulting in the little man getting pushed to the side while they fulfill orders from large customers. In the end, I wasted 3-months of my time waiting on my product to come that I never received. I did get a full refund.",0
Very professional and they sell great products. I was fortunate to get a customer in on their triple pane window special last month and will be watching out for it again next summer.,0
Helpful staff who are always friendly and will go the extra mile to assist you,0
Great Bludy Mary's,2
"Best location for metal doors, wood doors and windows!",0
Great shop friendly service.,0
Very nice people will encourage all my friends and would recommend to all,0
Awesome service. Helpful crew. Everyone was very nice,0
Excellent service quick always got what I need I own r.j. mobile so I use their service quite a bit they've always helped us out on the Kenai,0
Love these people. Always answer my questions !,0
Did a full roof replacement on my less than one year old Toyhauler and it looks better than Factory. The owner Mike is awesome along with his whole shop. Great people to work with highly recommend them.,0
My first choice for service on my travel trailer. Great staff and excellent service.,0
"I've been there twice, both times I have been treated like I'm the best customer they ever had. The employee's smile and everyone seems knowledgeable, Karen's RV is my new go-to service and RV parts stop.",0
"Squeezed me in when everybody else in town was booked out over a month. Fast, honest,friendly service.",0
"Really good place, and professional service",0
Friendly advice and lots of parts I needed in stock.,0
Very helpful and knowledgeable.,0
Helpful. Nice people,2
Great friendly place for anything you need for your RV or trailer,0
We didn't go inside. The outside of this location was in total disrepair and trash all over. If they let the outside get is such poor condition I can only imagine how the animals are living.,0
"Sheridan is the owner and she is very knowledgeable and friendly. Her prices are fair. The store is filled with many different animals and fish. I saw axolotls, turtles (who are fed chicken legs!), Ally the alligator, snakes, an iguana and varieties of fish. You'll notice that her fish are huge! That's a sign they're kept in a healthy environment. Valley Aquatics is a lovely place. I suggest any fish hobbyist or animal lover to check it out.",0
Sheridan is compassionate about reptiles and loves what she does. She is very knowledgeable and if she doesn't know something she will find the answer. Very enjoyable visit.,0
This is an awesome place for fish and aquarium products with an extremely knowledgeable owner. They also have a reptile and amphibian rescue center aswell as being credited for being the only fish rescue in Alaska! Pretty amazing in my opinion! So glad I found this place!,0
"Valley Aquatics is really defined to me by the people who take care of the animals here. Sheridan has a passion for the all of her slithery and swimmy friends here, and if you have an interest she has no problem finding one that'll take a liking to you (and that you'll love, too!) It's a hole-in-the-wall, but I'd come here over any big box store any day of the week.",0
Clean very clean.lady and her boys that run business extremely knowledgeable.,0
"One of the best Ones that have So many Different Kinds .Great Job Kodiak *High Rise,LLC",0
I'm extremely grateful that High Rise saw the potential in Kodiak! Thank u High Rise!,0

I love this salon and my hair has never looked better!,0
"Been to many different salons and dedicated only to this one for a while now. It's a pleasant visit every time. Absolutely Love it. Hayley is my favorite ðŸ˜â¤ all girls are great though. Been satisfied every time. My hair is perfect ðŸ˜ðŸ‘Œevery time. Place is super cute too, very clean, smells great - to me that matters tooðŸ˜…",0

Amazing service and my hair is gorgeous as always!!,0
Stacey is fabulous. Happy bright uplifting salon,0
"NOT WORTH IT !! I know its a school and the students are learning but we were not pleased with their service or product. Let us help you save your time and money recommend going to Academy of Hair design. You will get better product, service, and feel more welcomed with the same price. Thank me after.",0
The new location means less waiting and Edden who took care of me was great!,0
"I just had my hair cut by student Marley. She did a GREAT job on my hair. I'd recently had shoulder surgery, and Marley ensured to cut, wash and dry my hair without causing any discomfort. Marley asked SEVERAL times if I was comfortable and if I need anything. Both myself and my son got our hair cut. The instructor made sure that both of us were happy with everything. We were. 100/10 will have my hair cut by Marley again.",0
"The price is great, the student we had was understanding of my son's sensory issues. Friendly, great cut, and priced right.",0
When are you going to open up again for doing peoples hair? I keep calling and it's not even ringing. Maybe you guys shouldn't post that your open if your not actually open ethier.,0
"Great service, no one would have a right to get mad over a 10 dollar haircut.",0
Bristy is awesome and really fun to be around!,0
Cheap cut some times a long wait on weekends people are friendly.,0
I've worked with them several times. I've worked with Tom along in there and he's always been helpful and always trying to save me money as well. Questions from all about guns to shipping them to flying with them. Would recommend to anyone.,0
I hadnâ€™t been in the store for couple urs but i remember being treated great while shopping but when i stopped by this time i felt like the woman was rude. I think they were close to closing or something but either way i felt rushed and i just left. So i dont want this one interaction to prevent me from coming back but i donâ€™t recommend going close to closing lol,0
I walked in with questions and walked out with knowledge in just one visit. Great experience purchasing a suppressor and filling out the paperwork. I would definitely recommend them to anyone with an open mind looking to learn. I understand why some people think they are abrasive BUT thatâ€™s the sort of response you should expect if you walk into a store acting like you know everything and expecting to be treated like a king.,0
Great Northern Guns recommended for a suppressor. Everyone at the shop was knowledgeable and helpful. Got what I wanted without any problems.,0
"Unfortunately we walked in to look around, possible by a gun, and ask some questions, but we were never helped. 2 guys sat at the counter having a conversation and completely ignored us, so we just walked out. A shame for them, would have had a good customer",0
Took 2 day Concealed carry class was incredible. Went above and beyond state requirements to complete mental and firearm preparation to carry a firearm and be prepared to use it effectively and efficiently. Will NOT be my last class from them.,0
"I liked shopping here, Steve McDaniel is very nice and professional. I know I got overcharged on a firearm a few years ago, but it was hard finding the Glock 19 at that time so it was marked up an extra $75-$100 or so. I'd shop here again and would recommend them to others.",0
Great classes!! A++,2
"Probably the worst place to purchase firearms or get training because it's overpriced. They seem like those wack-job loonies you hear about on media that tries too hard to be military, but isn't. Avoid this place.",0
Best base pool weâ€™ve ever been to!,0
Great pool to just have fun with your family. The slide is a lot of fun. They have a lot of special events.,0
"Facilities are very nicely maintained, pool and lockeroom are great. Warm and inviting in the Frozen North in the winter time.",0
A great place to workout. Staff is very helpful.,0
Fun well set up,0
Very clean place..well organized,0
Very friendly and knowledgeable people. Highly recommend. Very reasonable prices as well.,0
I always got good service from this guys.,0
Mount and balanced snow tires on my truck day of despite being extremely busy. Probably the best price I could imagine. Would recommend for service. Many customers were comming and going that seemed to have lasting relationships with this place.,0
"These guys are great! They took my car in, same-day for a brake change and oil leak. They found a few additional issues with my car, but made sure to call me and give me a quote before doing any extra work.... Which is something I've had happen at other auto shops... They even charge for their service competitively (cheaper brake change than anywhere else I found). Overall, I'm very impressed with these guys and will be returning if I have any auto needs.",0
Amazing shop to get your car up and running. My family trust it with all our 6 cars.,0
Quality service $ reasonable prices,0
"Great guys, always get my work done here. Recommend it to all my fam & friends",0
Profesional and Quality work at a great price!!h,0
"Terrible took my car there twice to fix a bad gas tank, They ripped me off and said sorry WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. when I was on the phone with them to resolve the problem they hung up on me",0

Fast service. Super nice people.,0
"Awesome shop, friendly staff, even picked me up from the airport to get my vehicle. No complaints at all.",0
"Got an oil change done here, had a nice waiting area with free coffee and cold bottles of water.",0
"The employee at the counter is super professional, and always has a smile. Every time I need something from there for my customers, he always gets things done in a timely fashion.",0
"Great people very knowledgeable and friendly, speak English",0
Did not have the tires in stock that i needed but ordered and were shipped very quickly installed the next day they arrived!,0
The shuttle the offer is convenient,0
"Whether it be actual car accident help or just body mods, thereâ€™s no better place than here! They are knowledgeable and helpful! I call them for anything OEM.",0
They fixed two of my vehicles and gave me free details for Life they're awesome,0
They were so helpful assisting me in getting full payment to fix the damage from the insurance of the person who hit me. I can't recommend them enough! From the front desk to the manager everyone was great! Car was back in half the time too!,0
"Went in for a quote on a repair & repainting my vehicle. The repair was more than I expected (everything is these days), but to repaint the whole vehicle was astronomical! Won't be doing that anytime soon. I literally could but another vehicle for the cost of repainting this one. ðŸ¤¡",0
They did awesome job on my vechicle and was very fast on getting it back to me!,0
"My car looks like new after a windshield and scratches were fixed after someone vandalized it. It smelled great too, nice and detAiled and now I have detailing for life!",0
I have had two different vehicles worked on at this shop after they had each been hit. The customer service was incredible and now I have free detailing on both vehicles for as long as I own them. The work done on both cars was exceptional and done in a very timely manner. I will always recommend this shop to anyone needing work on their vehicles.,0
"They are great!! I can't say enough nice things about Tyler and the crew there. They go above and beyond for their customers. Gathering paperwork, taking pictures, lining up care for vehicles, keeping me updated on everything, giving me recommendations, even talking with me about my options for buying a replacement vehicle when mine was totalled. Price, where I might go, what kind of vehicle I might like. They have drinks and snacks while you wait. And to top it off, if you spend over a certain amount with your vehicle, you get a full detail 4 times a year FOR LIFE! They even steamclean the carpets! Love this place.",0
"AMAZING! From fixing my car to detailing it, I cannot think of anyone better",0
"Great service, quick, courteous and professional. Totally recommend.",0
"Slid my poor car into a ditch on my way to work last month. Greg Peede saw and pulled me out, then recommended I come to his work to have it looked at. When I got there, Rick took care of everything for me. They patched my window so I wouldn't get cold and cleaned up all the broken glass. Then they coordinated with my insurance for me to get repairs done. It took a little over a week to do them, but you won't hear any complaints from me. They did an excellent job replacing the entire door and rear window, and even changed a dead headlight for me. Not to mention, detailed the whole thing when they were done. Thank you!",0
Worked on our car super fast and adjusted to our accommodations,0
Great customer service,2
Great company. When you want a company that does it right choose T.C.M.,0
They did a phenomenal job. From showing up quick after hours and cleaning up my water damage extremely well. They knew alot and taught us everything we wanted to know. I highly recommend this company they are all about customer service and happiness and it shows! I give them 5 stars for being such a great company. Thank you.,0
"They showed up the day after I called them from 6hrs away. They pulled all my kitchen cabinets off the wall, tore up my floor until they found dry, tore all of the wet insulation out of my walls, set up lg fans & dried us all out! Then they sent a full itemized list their work as well as another itemized list of repairs to my insurance company. My insurance cut the 1st check instantly to pay for services rendered & I just received a check for the cost of the rest of the repairs. I'm not sure if/what I'll use them for right now as far as restoring things back to the way they were... but they do offer that service too! It's the dead of winter here in Alaska & I'm going to keep chugging along trying to get it done on my own. We'll see what's left after the thaw.",0
This place is the place to call when you need to get your house back to brand new. The crew always provides awesome service and everyone is always friendly and they work with you.,0
"Fast response, very efficient and thorough. Knowledgeable and helpful staff.",0
Best Company Best Products i would rate them 6 stars out of 5 ! These guys make me Happy !!,0
"When traveling for business I'm always looking for something other than burgers or pizza. In Juneau, in the winter, options are slim but in was pleasantly surprised to find a Peruvian restaurant! I had the Saltado - it was fabulous. The fries with the rice was strange, but that's how they do it and it was good! I will be eating here again next time I'm in town.",0
"Their bacon Empanada is award winning and meets the their award. The ham and cheese was not so great. ( like it was heated a few times, pastry was to hard to bite though.",0
"The food is quite tasty. The Peruvian empanadas has a flavorful filling, but the crust is guey instead of crumbly and flaky. Their chicken, potatoes, rice or the pork, beans, rice are very filling and good, leaving no room for dessert. Their portions are huge, recommend you agree on one entree to share for two or three people. We had to get a couple of take away boxes as we couldn't finish. They have a Peruvian pork sandwich made with a deep fried pork was very disappointing. The pork was dry, tough, overcooked, I wanted to send it back, but when asked how I liked their food, I told told them I didn't. The woman who cooked the food offered to redo it.",0
"Great food! For main plates, but also lots of other options in side dishes as well.",0
"Food is bland. Service was the worst. The server couldn't explain one of the specials because ""they don't sell it a lot."" He had to get someone else to explain the menu to us and it ended up being a child. The child also rang us up at the end.",0
Great food... reasonable prices. Simple menu,0
Interesting food. Very rich and heavy. We were the only patons on a Thursday evening.,0
"The food is really good, and the prices are fair. I have a little heartache that they changed the beans from canary beans to pinto beans, because canary beans were far more delicious.",0
Amazingly delicious unique food and over the top friendly service!,0
Great food and run by a nice family! Try the Lomo Saltado!,0

"I absolutely LOVE this vet! They work with you on everything from price to treatment plan. I originally moved to this vet when my goose got a broken foot. Their ingenuity in creating a splint for him was amazing. They yet again went above and beyond when it came to my dog's broken paw. We needed to bring her in to have her splint and dressings redone, but due to covid and needing to quarantine we were unable to come in. They not only offered to do an online meeting to walk us through the process, but they delivered all the necessary materials to our front door! I really couldn't ask for a better, more caring, or considerate group.",0
Our pup is always feeling better after a visit here. Thanks Dr. Rember for taking such good care of our guy!!,0
I use this clinic for all my k9 needs. The staff and vets make me feel so comfortable. They make my pets feel comfortable also. I have not had that kind of experience with any veterinary clinic in the Fairbanks North Star Borough. I have been here several times now and have always had the same type of experience. Also they are very reasonably priced and down-to-earth and do not seem to push unnecessary procedures on to your pet. It's nice to know that there are still people out there that has your pets best interest in mind.,0
"Ive been to a couple different vets for my furry family members but these guys by far are some of the nicest, gentlest and caring vets/staff i have meet. They did amazing with my mastiff and even when the visit was done the vet was looking into finding out more ways to help our dog. They are great.",0
They are friendly and my dog was well cared for,0
"Excellent service, knowledgeable staff. They were very kind with the loss of our cat and helping us out.",0
"Our dogs have been going for 2 years, always helpful, great at explaining things!",0
Sweet little lady had procedure done on her ear. Fantastic staff! Not too costly,0
"While traveling Alaska for the summer, our older dog got sick, and they were able to get us right in the same day. From the Secretary to the Vet Tech to the Vet herself, they were so kind and so professional....really eased our worries. Would definitely recommend! (And within 24 hrs, you would never know our dog had been sick at all!)",0
Very helpful and friendly. My dog had a great experience there. It was fast and got meds to help her belly feel better.,0
The vet and every single tech truly care,0
"They know my boys, they treat us right.",0
"Dr. Milman is amazing for me. I was at a different vet who I told that my dog was itching a lot, and all they said was that dogs fo that, which I wasn't really satisfied with, and just looked at my dog. I went to Dr. Milman and she offered options of what it could be and actually held my dog and told me my dog had a slight skin infection, which is bad but still good to know, which I appreciate. The staff are very friendly and the space is cozy and homey.",0
You can take your pets here and know that they are in good hands. My two dogs are my babies and after taking them here I wouldn't go anywhere else. Dr. Alex and his staff were so good with them that they didn't even have the usual anxiety they would get going to a vet. One of my dogs had surgery and Dr. Alex did such a good job she wanted to be on her feet as usual right after. I had to restrain her activity to make sure she had time to heal. I've been here with my pets several times now so I can say with confidence that this clinic is among the best.,0
Staff was exceptional!,2
"Very nice staff. They all seemed to actually care about my dogs problems, and spent extra time checking her over.",0
"Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I went to another vet for my dogs ear and they told me it was probably allergies. Then I came here and instead treated him for the yeast infection he had, and he has been better since.",0
Very pricey overcharged methey charged me for the nurse to see my pet they charge me for the doctor to see my pad they charge me for disposing the thermometer with poop on it I wasn't happy at all the doctor does not solve the problem with my,0
Great place to take your pets. Very friendly and professional.,0

Great service very friendly fast and quality work,0
"Best Truck tire shop in town Richard, Ron and Marshall are knowledgeable and if u tell them what u are doing with the truck and what you want out of your tires ie better traction or treadwear they will steer you in the right direction as far as wheels and tires go and in my experiance with them when things go wrong they have stepped up and made it right for me. Only happened once in over 7yrs of doing business with them but Ron handled it with coutesy and professionalism. Highly recommend this place for truck and trailer, farm tractor, motor grader, loader, Even forklift tires!",0
Great service! Great tires,0

Jacob stulic made a work of art personal for me. This tattoo means more then the actual tattoo but what it represents to me. I didn't let the demons take me out I survived the night and got my Affirmation the very next a.m.,0
"My daughter has experienced several struggles in her young life. Having just turned 20 she desperately wanted a symbol to start adulthood. When she visited Kiko he was beyond generous with his time discussing her vision. When she confided in him her deepest wish was covering scars on her wrist he supported her with a brotherly love, a compassion and understanding that was matched by his extraordinary skill as an artist. My daughter now has hope when she looks at herself. She has confidence and moreover is optimistic about the future. One man today changed so many lives. What a truly magnificent human being.",0
"Jacob did a very good job on my tattoo I love them so much, very nice person, good environment.",0
"BEST shop in Anchorage. Devin is awesome! Very, very talented!!",0
"Squeezed me in last minute and didn't rush through the tattoo. Chris did a great job, was professional, and did some awesome work. we'll go back for more work and will definitely recommend.",0
"Devin has been my tattoo artist for a quite a while this year and he is really skilled and talented with what he can do, but during my last visit about 5 weeks ago I went and got a tattoo done and I mean up to this day my tattoo still hurts and it looks like itâ€™s still trying to heal... the rest of my previous tattoos Devin did healed fine but this one ... it still hurts...During my time at Valla Gallery, there was a lady there with him and it was about 8pm, they made plans while Devin was trying to get everything set up and by the time she had left it hit 9 pm.. in the middle of getting my tattoo done he got a call from her asking what time heâ€™d be done and everything so after that call Devin started pacing up his work and it hurt soooo bad like he was in a rush so he started beating the tattoo gun really hard into my skin.. I really regret getting my tattoo done that evening, but next time at least put the time and the effort into what youâ€™re actually doing instead of getting pushed around to the point where you donâ€™t care about your client at all. Remember this is permanent for the rest of my life. â€œðŸ’²/ðŸ§â™€ï¸â€œ ?? . . . Looking back, i shouldnâ€™t have gave him a tip because I personally think she messed it up and Iâ€™m possibly going to feel this pain forever. Thank you.",0
The workman ship was awesome. He's working on a fixer upper. 1st sitting I was VERY IMPRESSED. WOULD RECOMMEND HIM TO EVERYONE . Job well done kiko!!ðŸ˜ƒ,0
"I had a consult here. Did not like the look of the place. Very shabby and under construction or empty and dirty. Didn't look professional. Really nice guy, and his portfolio looks like he does good work.",0
"Definately best place in town, a little expensive but certainly worth every bit. Very Talented artists with a passion for their work and easy going personality, as well as comfortable, homely, atmosphere.",0
Too expensive for a small piece,0
Have been here a couple of times and all was great until we purchased Permafrost in .5 preroll. Several are more like .25. I feel we were shorted. The Cabin Fever in .5 great and were .5,0

They always seem to carry quality bud,0
"Young lady with great skills, upfront and honest. Best Iâ€™ve ever had in anchorage.",0
I stopped in for a pedicure and I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else now. Thuy (Twee) went above and beyond. I have never had such a thorough pedicure done before. I got a lavender jelly pedicure with french tips and she removed callouses from my feet that have been there for years. My legs are tingling an hour later and I feel so refreshed. I am definitely going to be a routine customer!,0
Always great service!,2

The Best Ever!,2
The only place I will go!!,0
Everyone is kind and courteous and very helpful...,0
"Updated â€“ 2020 I still come here once a week depending on the staff is how the service will go. Sometimes when I go in the morning thereâ€™s a young lady cashier that I prefer her not to have to interact with. I saw her tree another customer in my opinion poorly she was condescending, impatient, & short with her answers making the customer uncomfortable as well as myself. So now I just come in the afternoon depending on which day it is I get different workers and theyâ€™re all very nice so unless you really need something early in the morning, Iâ€™d say go in the afternoon the store is not as busy and the staff are all friendly. 2018- I always get my cigs here they are the cheapest that i have found lol. Besides this the staff is friendly and helpful. This store is usually stocked and clean. And the pharmacy is fast too.",0
Always very helpful. Never judgemental about purchases that mat have negative connotations.,0
THE WORST PHARMACY IN ANCHORAGE. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. EXTREMELY SLOW. WILL NOT GO HERE AGAIN.,0
"Hire more people, pay more get better or more happy employees. I know its busy i am always waiting in line.",0
"Location is notorious for vehicle break-ins, vagrants and pan handlers... had two people approach me on my way in and way out asking for money and I reported to management. In the last 25 minutes waiting for a script to be filled Iâ€™ve continued to watch people being pestered continually with one guy arguing with him and two people received inappropriate hand gestures after walking away",0
"Pleasant cashiers, pharmacy staff.",0
"Haven't had any terrible experiences, the pharmacy always seems to be understaffed. Being near a major buys huh they seem to have local trouble. I honestly don't shop here very often. This location seems to be left out of products like the star wars makeup.",0
I was able to do my laundry quick and I was out of there!,0
Secure storage reasonable rates easy access security cameras in place,0
"We kept our belongings at Forbes for a couple of months. You have to put in your code to open the gate to get into where the lockers are, that you put your own lock on. There was an issue once where we were charged double, but it was quickly fixed with no problems from staff. The aisles are hard to turn at the ends which is the only negative thing I have to say. I felt my belongings were very secure here.",0

"She is the absolute best groomer ever, she is the only one I'll take my fur babies to no matter how far booked out she is!",0
Bianca is one of the best dog groomers that's handled my dog. He gets excited when we pull up to the business. He loves the doggie treats he gets afterwards too.,0
Bianca is amazing I have a 1 year chow who is scared of water and loud noises. I have tried getting him groomed before at another dog grooming place but it didn't work out. He loved his experience with her and he looks perfect I'll never go anywhere else five stars.,0
By far the best experience with a dog groomer.,0
"Studio K9 is off the beaten path, but is well worth the visit. Appointments are needed, but we have had our best grooming experiences there. Dogs are ready when promised, unlike 2 other places we have tried.",0
Best and most reliable groomer in Fairbanks.,0
Great experience for the dogs.,0

Its awrite just mad they close so soon,0
They sell other things besides gas. Go inside and the same bubbly worker who is always there is there. Great service and awesome when I needed to price check multiple candy bars to get the best value.,0
Expensive gas and very rude people. There repair department is extremely expensive than unreliable,0
Who's the hot native girl thst works there?,0
It's not very lit up,0
"This was a great place. Plain and simple. They put a doughnut on the milkshake as a garnish so they get an A+ immediately. The shake was amazing too. They offered other menu items, had quick service and was clean. It was a good experience.",0
"Love this place! Adorable staff, Absolute BEST burgers in town 100% no debate about it .... Very good chef w/ steak house experience at Baranoff Hotel Steak House. In other words, your food is prepared right. My absolute favorite place to get a quick bite. Well worth the money also ..... 5 â­â­â­â­â­ People love the shakes.",0
"First time there. Had biscuits and sausage gravy. Pretty good, but too much baking soda in the biscuits. Not sure if they were from a mix or not. One small complaint: one table, when I arrived had dirty dishes on it. Not much of a problem because there were sufficient tables available. But they were not picked up until shortly before I was finished.",0
Literally massive portion for like 10 bucks. Much more bang for your buck than Gonzo. I got the California scramble with ham. Definitely gonna come here again,0
"I love their vanilla milkshake because it is smooth and taste great, it also comes with a delightful donut + cherry surprise. I love their maui waui ice cream because the flavors are so vivid. I love their pizza because it isnt to greasy and the chesse taste great. My favirote side is the fries because their a classic. Last of all the service is great my sister and i were afraid of a bug at our table and the waiter quickly killed it. Btw there was only a bug because it was sunny and the door was open, not cause it was messy the place is very clean! Great place for a bite!",0
"Auke Bay Cafe now occupies what used to be GonzoAK. The offerings include breakfast, lunch, and starting February 17, extend it's hours to 2100 and offer Mexican food for dinner from 1700-2100, Italian dishes to follow, with intended food delivery. The Denver omelet was good, enough to share with another. Their garden salad is pretty good, offering more than just the bare necessity with beans, bell peppers, tomatoes.",0
"Basic, and exceptionally disappointing even for Juneau. Ordered A LOT of food with coworkers for lunch, boss got a halibut sandwich that was all breading, â€œbuttermilk fried chicken sandwichâ€ isnâ€™t even KIND of close, just some sort of fried chicken finger from Costco. Coworker who picked it up told us that the line cooks donâ€™t wear gloves AT ALL never saw them wash their hands even after touching multiple surfaces and zero masks worn. Worst $50 ever spent",0
"My husband went in for ice cream. He spoke to them two people working there about getting service. They both walked away. I can't say if the food is good because we didn't get any food, just a cold shoulder.",0
"Front wait staff was fine, but cook staff have no netting coverage on beards. Restaurants in Juneau have this problem.",0
Large breakfast menu. Serves breakfast and lunch and dinner.,0

Donna did my first perm in many years and I love it. Curls to spare and no time wasted with a curling iron and 2 pounds of hair spray.,0
"The haircuts are a great price, it was $13 for a cut (men and women). The stylist was quick but also did exactly what I wanted. I got a way better haircut here than I did at the places in town that charge way more.",0
Wonderful perms and hair styling at a reasonable price. Highly recommend Donna.,0
5 stars all day. Highly recommend. Great haircut for a reasonable price.,0

Tires take 3.5 hrs to change with an appointment... Go out of business already what a joke... Worst place,0
Had a great eye exam at Sears optical,0
Wish I could rate 0 stars. Customer service is absutely horrendous.,0
My experience was so bad that I hope never to do business with Sears again. The folks at checkout were incompetent and the equipment wasn't functioning properly.,0

Fast and friendly. Best Crab Rangoon in Anchorage!,0
"Just spent $35 for 2 lunch entrees. $3 for fried rice upgrade? What a rip off. I finished mine, and am now hungry 5 minutes later. The meat was burnt from being cooked too long in the deep fryer. The flavor of the sauce was good, just bad food. Bad food, horrible portions, the driver was a nice older man, which really doesn't make up for the bad food.",0
Delicious! This place is great! Don't over look it because its in a food court. The staff is friendly and the food is inexpensive. I think the most expensive item on the menu was $12.,0
"Ordered just before 4 pm on a Saturday got here at 430. Great timing. Got a great wonton soup, and shrimp lo mein the shrimo were great size. All around happy with my order.",0
Spicy sesame chicken is awesome! Delivery times are short. I highly recommend for Chinese food.,0
OMG theyre like sam & lees in barrow. Found my 3 combo here in Anch.,0
Food was very fresh and quickly prepared for pick up.,0
I just called the place of delivery and the lady who answered with a very nasty attitude asked me to place an order on GrubHub because it's too busy or something ridiculous I was going out on a limb to try this place out if you're looking for good service right off the bat I would miss this place.,0
Food was kinda dry and rice was undercooked,0
Was a total surprise hole in the wall at Sears mall,0
Best fried rice in Anchorage!! Yum!!,0
"OTC has tools, used parts, and reference books for you to learn to fix your own bike! If you get stuck, the Volunteers are thrilled to help! They also sell used bikes and accept bike donations.",0
Quintissential bike co-op.,2
Great place. They help you work on your own bike which sounds weird but is really great because you get to learn. They let you borrow their tools and the pricing is great.,0
Great place..we got my bike figured out quick And gained some knowledge . More than fair pricing for some help and access to tools.,0
great place. wish they were open more hours!,0
"Volunteer staff were very friendly, managed to get access to the tools I needed to change out my bike seat, and also picked up a kids bike helmet. Left a few dollars in the tip box and look forward to going back when I need to tune up my bike.",0
I bought a bike for $45 that lasted two seasons worth of riding.,0
"Went with my toddler for the open swim, it's very hard to complain as this is a great indoor activity at a unbeatable price. Generally the pool, changing rooms etc. were clean, showers hot etc. I like that there is a built in shallow pool for kids / wheelchair users. The atmosphere was fairly school gymnasium like, would be better if there were more water toys for young kids to play with. Biggest complaint would be the lack of clear signage of where the pool is, how to buy entrance tickets, where to store belongings and general rules to follow.",0
"This place defines average and the term of failing at nothing, but not going for the gold. It is a good pool for events or parties, but the pool at UAA and West are better options. It is clean, safe and accessible, but is average. Keep in mind that there is no problem in being average, just there are better options out there if you can use them. But if you just want a quick swim, this will do juat fine.",0
"Fun place for students, friends and families to hangout. Mostly see athletes relaxing here and children swimming. ðŸŠðŸ…",0
Wonderful how they let us host special Olympics state games.,0
Probably the most well maintained pool in town and the staff is super nice.,0
My boys like it and why not it's not expensive at all and if I go and put everything by me no one well steal it lol,0
It's fun to an extent until little kids start going crazy,0

Eddie is one of the BEST bartenders that I have had the pleasure to meet. Had a blast there.,0
I love this bar. The Lee's are awesome people and they run a nice place. Its one of my favorite places to catch a band and have a drink.,0
"The best dive bar on the peninsula and the best bar in Soldotna. Family owned and operated, chillest crowd, cold beer, and the most satisfying whiskey sours you'll ever taste. Can't be beat.",0
Great place for fun,0
Great bar! Cozy and full of locals. Catch a fishing story or some live music!,0
"Only stopped in once but they had a band playing and they were pretty good, had a good time.",0
Clean and quiet. Great bartender.,0

"Nice lake retreat to rent all types of boats including small sail boats â›µï¸, great prices by the hour. Beautiful area and somewhat quiet lake if there is not a big party going on in the nearby rec. center building. Recommend for a relaxing afternoon or evening., cabins available to rent also .",0
"Otter Lake is on JBER (military installation). We were so blessed to find it. They have dry cabins for $50/night. It was so cool to stay in a real log cabin with a wood burning stove. The log cabin has a bunk bed for the kids and a queen bed for us. There's also a pull out couch, dinette, mini fridge and microwave. They also have an outdoor picnic table and fire pit. You do need to bring all your bed linens and such, but I mean what a cool experience! We used the gym nearby to take showers (and bonus, swim in the pool too). We were also able to have some fun on the lake. They have canoes, John boats and those water bike things for rent for true summer fun. We loved our weekend away here and recommend it to all of our friends. As for reservations, just be persistent. Usually it's one or two people working the whole place. They probably aren't going to respond to you right away. Leave a message and they will more than likely call you back. If not, try again. It's worth it! I mean look at the view from our porch. Our kids still think that the cabin we rented is our own personal cabin. They consider it a second home. So bottom line, this is a nice and affordable place to stay in Anchorage and get an Alaskan experience.",0
Clean and fun fishing,0
I love this place! Its absolutely gorgeous and a great place for a barbeque. But beware of the horsflies. We had hundreds of them swarming our car when we drove up and they continued to chase us the entire time we were there. There is no way to avoid them so maybe don't go in July or August but definitely still enjoy it when you can!,0
Great place. Beautiful lake. $7.00 an hour to rent boats is very decent price.,0
Otter Lake is a nice place to go hang out on the water.,0

Awesome lake to spend the day at with the family. Super wallet friendly prices for rentals.,0
"Plugged my tire for $20 in the same day. Able to drop my truck off and pick it up before they closed on both occasions I needed work. Second time was when I needed to put my summer tires back on. I was able to drop it off and get it done the same day. All the places around town weâ€™re booked out for a few days, and Costco wonâ€™t help unless you bought tires there.",0
True to their name but not at the expense of the work or customer service!,0
"I've done quite a bit of business here on several different vehicles. the customer service is excellent, the work has always been quality, they are willing to look at other quotes and be fair and reasonable.",0
Convenient and decent prices,0

"The two times I've been in they didn't have their beer license yet, but their pizza is awesome! We've had three different pizzas from there and they are all near the top of the list for best in the state. Can't wait to try their beer",0
Beautiful place and friendly people.,0
Pizza was delicious but EXTREMELY expensive,0
Waited a bit. Friendly & knowledgeable. Clean.,0
Staff not to knowledgable,0

I was impressed by the high quality of the yarn and other goods in the store. We were helped right away and made to feel welcome. The staff answered all of our questions. They were knowledgeable and friendly.,0
Excellent shop! Visiting from PA - stopped in Quality and quantity is amazing. Staff friendly and most helpful. Anyone who knits or crochets will find what they need.,0
I always love stopping in. Everyone is so kind and helpful.,0
I loved the atmosphere in this quant store. Quality products and authentic employees. A roundtable is stationed in the middle of the store...all are welcome to hang out and work on projects while visiting with crafters that share the love of yarn.,0
The yarn offered here are so beautiful and soft. Needles are high quality and if you need help you can talk with any of the staff and they can help you from a question about a piece you are working now or a piece you want to work on in the future.,0
I have a hard time finding what I need here but I do always find something delightful...even if it wasnâ€™t what I needed. The ladies that own this shop are so sweet and helpful!,0
This place is ALWAYS awesome.,0
Best yarn shop in Anchorage,0
Friendly Staff and always funny gifts to find here. I do like looking at the gems that they have. I found a pretty ring and studded earrings of fireweed gemstones.,0
Absolutely adorable and humorous store. The best souvenir shop you can find in Seward! They have a lot of souvenirs with moose on them and are very funny!,0
Good collection of wacky Alaska stuff for gifting. I got 2 t-shirts and tattoo sticker.,0
"Good, touristy Alaska stuff",0
Amazing place to have party's at or gatherings and the food is amazing and good people.,0

Winter wonderland for sledding.,0
Worth a stop,2
We had far better service to get around town before rearrangement of schedule and routes now you can't even get to the loussac library on a public bus passing it directly and it is the largest library in the Anchorage area,0
A guy was standing in front of the muse museum shelter people mover stop giving out bus schedules and day pass to kets awesome sauce,0
The bus driver's don't even leave when there supposed to thay leave early,0
Bus stop signs and Busses need to say on their bus signs ( broken down or getting repaired) and ( the bus is full). One bus said it was 11 and got to stop sign to stop at intersection then when it got to my stop It said out of service and it kept going. I didn't know nothing. It just drove by me.,0
Great place for employment in Alaska,0
Nice staff and clean buses.,0
Hobo infested buses.,2
"Nice place but not in my budget, cost more than the Alaska Club and has less to offer",0
Shawn is my trainer and he's the best!,0
staff were more then helpful and willing to help with my needs,0
"Great gym. This gym has fantastic pricing, childcare, and plenty of equipment to choose from. The personnel are always extremely helpful, and the childcare option is great. The only negative is childcare staff changes frequently leading to some inconsistency in care, but so far all have been attentive and caring.",0
"Solid, not typically too crowded. It has what you need and is priced reasonably.",0
Love my trainer and the gym is nice but they need music.,0
I have been a member here for years. And in the last couple years this place has gone way WAY down hill. It's always dirty and the equipment is not kept up very well anymore. It's like they just dont care anymore. Kinda sad really it used to be a good alternative to the over priced other place out here. Now not so much.,0
"For $40-ish bucks a month, you can't beat these amenities. You get cardio, free weights, spin classes, etc. etc. etc. These guys are way more affordable than the alternative. My only gripe is the carpeted locker rooms that tend to stink from time to time.",0
"As far as gyms go, BR is a great value. For 1/3 of the cost of the Alaska Club we have a membership that includes unlimited tanning. I have never had any issues with availability of machines to use and I have never felt like I was in a cramped space (like I did at the Summit Gym).",0
"It was quite easy to sign-up, but cancelling before end of term was a bit difficult. This gym is not for heavy weight lifters as they primarily have cardio and ""pulley"" machines. Their free weights are very limited. At the same time, it's good enough for the ""general fitness"" types.",0
Work out ... amazing staff,0
They nickel and dime you. Go somewhere else. No prorated childcare when you cancel. Garbage service. You have to cancel in person even if you move out of state. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this place to anyone.,0
Wife and I love that it is clean and open at hours that work well for us.,0
They are always friendly and courteous.,0
Nice new building. That's about it.,0
Great staff Clean and friendly,0
Great exercise equipments,2
Friendly hard working staff,0
Pizza was good. Prepared fast and easy to bake. For the price though I don't think it was worth it. I'll probably go to Papa Joe's on the old Seward next time and grab a hot pie.,0
Always fresh and great staff.,0
They were not able to keep up with demand. 90 minutes for two pizzas ordered online.,0
I always have to buy two tubs of chocolate chip cookie dough since one never makes it to the oven. Their pizza is never cold when you pull it out of your own oven.,0
Always delicious. We often pick up a pizza after shopping at Carrs. Last time was really yummm. Not sure it was more delicious that normal.,0
Consistent with other Papa Murphy locations. The drive through is fantastic and a nice addition.,0
Had a great evening. Not the Lone Ranger,0
Nice clean private club. Go see Veronica for great service.,0
Awsome place and people.,0
Can't go wrong with cheap drinks and karaoke on saturdays!,0
Meet other vets,2
"Superb Service- a cut above. Professional, expedient and reliable work. They got me in and out the same day and for a much better price than I expected. The manager Ben was personable and offered to let me wait in their luxurious lounge with Big Screen TV and complimentary coffee.",0
"Great friendly service, everyone there was very nice and appreciative of me being a customer. Did great body work after my first ever accident, eased my way through the process. They handled the communication with my insurance company. Gave me a lot of peace of mind and fully trusted all their work.",0
This shop is awesome! They got us in and taken care of in the same day. Best prices we found in town! And they were so nice and genuinely helpful! I would 10/10 recommend and me and my family will definitely be back! ðŸ˜,0
The repair facility and team are top drawer!,0

Very personable staff,2
"Newly opened, first of its kind, drive though",0
I really enjoy the people that go there and that work there. But I would like to see some of the washers get fixed.,0
Wow has this placed changed. I used to come here every week to do my laundry and it was spotless. Now itâ€™s a filthy place. My clothes had a weird smell to them when done. They need to clean those machines!,0
Fairly clean showers and laundromat. Workers are pleasant and helpful.,0
Nice hot showers.,2
"These folks are awesome. Showers are always clean, washers and dryers make quick work of laundry. Free water for filling water jugs if you live in a dry cabin.",0
"The cleanest laundromat I've ever been too (including the showers) and the lady who works the a.m.shift, she's fantastic!",0
Nice place clean showers,0
"Good working laundry machines, folding tables and chairs, attended present, laundry products for sale, change machines, double front swinging doors , large utility sink access, bathrooms, showers, tanning, snacks, games, play area with toys, large screen TV's",0
Very nice place that treats you like family,0
"Kind staff, reasonably priced machines.",0
It's clean well maintained and the people are friendly.,0
Excellent laundry mat n shower facility!!,0
Has everything a person could want in washer dryers and showers,0
The availability and ease-of-use,0
"came here to use as a tanning facility and since it's not their primary operation, the tanning options available are few but as a tanning salon in big lake, it's an added perk, especially to someone who is looking to pass time while doing laundry.",0
"Very clean. Showers are priced well, laundry a little expensive.",0
There kinda rude towards me the last few times,0
Clean and friendly,2
Very clean showers,2
"Hours aren't accurate, but good service",0
"Returned trailer here. After a bit of phone help, we got the trailer returned. After hours, so no one in office. Owners did return since they run campground nearby. Return went very smoothly!",0
"""Very nice customer service, food was good plenty of table space for the family and nice comfy recliners for the group of two and a nice big group table for the family of 5 or more. Very nice prices for there food and delicious coffe.",0
"O. M. Yum! Had the Chicken salad croissant sandwich with tomato basil soup and it was delish! Inviting, cozy atmosphere, excellent customer service and competitve pricing. I will definitely be going back!",0
Their Gluten Free Chicken Salad Sandwich hit the spot!,0
Large lots of seating friendly people expensive soft ice cream,0
"Great quiet place to meet with friends for lattes, pastries , etc.. Drive thru window as well. Try it!",0
Great lunch place. Great owner,0
"Worse coffee for sure, offed another cup but will be same.. cost $4.25 and yes they didnâ€™t offer it back Will tell people about place",0
Loved every thing about that place,0
"A very knowledgeable guy when it comes to torque converters, fast friendly a very proud man about his craft",0
Pork is the best. Always 5 stars,0
Great knowledge and friendly service,0
Porky is Very knowledgeable tons of torque converter and other parts,0
"Very Friendly service, high quality torque converters that are literally cut open, and everything inside rebuilt, cleaned, and in most cases updated to prevent common problems/ breakage (example the pump shaft hub splines in the AX4S/AX4N original converters are weak pot metal, and he updates these to steel to prevent a needless loss of pump action) If he doesn't have a part, he can order it fairly quickly. Very good business to do business with. I recommend him very highly.",0
Quick service and decent pricing,0
Love this place,2
Nice people very helpful easy access and they have lots of tools,0
Very friendly and helpful staff. Reasonable in price too.,0
Good service fair price,0
Need it fixed by the weekend or maybe it just needs looked at give them a call!,0
Took great care of us,0
"The Pioneer Home in Palmer is a very friendly, upbeat center. Filled with many Alaska Seniors in various physical states. Each is treated as an individual and all are known by their names by staff and greeted in passing. I was there on Halloween and they had small children with parents as well as teens, dressed and excitedly travelling the halls. My friends father had been hospitalized in Anchorage from the home shortly before this. She said it was so comforting when several times individual staff from the Pioneer Home had driven to Anchorage and sat in his room with him prior to his passing. It is a clean and comfortable center and serves lunch each day, Snacks, and dinner.",0
"Always a great place to get the party started right. Even though you can't actually enter the building right now, you can still hang in the courtyard and party like its 1909.",0
Hope I dont wind up here but glad its there.,0
"The Veterans are absolutely wonderful here. A really nice, clean place, and the staff are exceptionally superb.",0
Great facility. Very homey and spacious. Wonderful employees who enjoy their jobs.,0

Nice staff for the best veterans,0
"The staff is considerate and kind, the facility is pleasant, my grandma is happy there.",0
The best place to work and visit,0
"I've been going to the Pioneer home very long time. It is run by the state, you have to be a veteran or a Pioneer to live there.",0
"It was not the best gingerbread house this year, maybe the earthquake had a effect on them.",0
They do the maintenance on my truck and I never have trouble with it.,0
"Fair prices. There's a junkyard there so you can often find used parts for cheap. Also, does good mechanic work.",0
I never used them.,0
Best auto mechanic services around,0
Answered every question I had,0
This biz is the biz,0
"Hillside Family Medicine is closed during lunch hours. If you're looking for a doctor, but you need flexibility due to your schedule then consider Hillside Family Medicine. I work late hours, so I can only see a doctor near 5 PM or on weekends. Hillside Family Medicine always does their best to get me an appointment the next day or during that week. The doctors and employees are very polite. Plenty of parking, but awkward leaving the parking lot due to adjacent intersection. If this review was helpful please click the Like button.",0
"Update, I still really love my Doctor, I also dont mind having to wait so long to get an appointment or call for a same day. I do however have a problem with making an appointment and waiting for longer than 15 minutes to be taken back, then another 10 minutes or longer for the doctor. I feel like this is a scheduling issue that has only gotten worse. I have been coming here for over 15 years. It's kinda ridiculous that this is a common problem. I go to my appointments on my lunch break. I have to drive there, then wait 25 minutes past my appointment time to actually be seen.",0
"The front desk staff was Nice but if you are trying to ever do same day appointments be prepared to get put on hold and transferred 3-5times. Then told that even though you have been calling since 8am when they open all the appointments are full. Again front desk staff was great but if you've been sick for 3weeks, brand new to town, and finally had a day that works for you to see the doctor. Do not ever do same day appointments here. Plan ahead well if you can.",0
"I've always had a good experience and have been going to the same place for years. The staff has always been helpful, respectful, courteous, patient, professional and knowledgeable as well as efficient and personable. The PAC Rachel has been wonderful with all of my health-care needs and questions. I would recommend to anyone.",0
"Both the office and medical staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Importantly, too, they are willing to offer up alternative treatments to their diagnoses, which was good for me, because there were certain things with which I would have been uncomfortable. They just seem like they are trying to find the best solution to health issues that really work for me personally.",0
Super friendly staff and they went well out of their way to help me and my family,0
"My boys and I see Dr Julie Wilson. She is amazing. Even though she isn't a ped, I take my boys to her.",0
"Do NOT go to Rachael Coleman! She doesn't listen to you and doesn't call back with important test results. If you want to find out any of your results, you have to call the clinical staff repetitively. Avoid the stress and frustration and go ANYWHERE but here.",0
"Scheduled an appointment - waited for 2 weeks. On the day of appointment, I was told that there was no appointment made.",0
Very knowledgeable doctors,2
I've been tanning here for nearly 10 years! Love it.,0
"Always friendly, always have a bed available, the prices are great, there is no downside which impresses me!",0
Great place. Very friendly and clean. Beds are warm...,0
Best tanning beds in the state of Alaska. The service is 100% prices are 100% best girls out of all the tanning salons in Valley. ðŸ¤©,0
"The beds are well kept and the establishment is clean. The prices are fair, and the employees are super friendly too â˜ºï¸",0
"The girls are always friendly, and it's very clean inside. I have been going to Sunsation for years and will never go anywhere else in the state of Alaska!",0

Friendly service and advice. I purchased a salt lick and the young man there carried it out to my vehicle without even being asked! Treats for the dog too. Highly recommended.,0
The lady was a bit smug in the morning. Seems like an ok spot for feed and some smaller items.,0
Knowledgeable and friendly! Love it!!,0
"The most helpful, caring staff! Quiet environment full of everything we need for our farm! Will never go anywhere else!",0
Couldn't find their location the number was never answered when I called on different occasions and this location on google is incorrect.,0

"This is a great stop! I havenâ€™t had the milkshakes but was so tempted. I went for an iced latte and it was fantastic! They have more on the menu then the average Alaskan coffee stand, including Polish or Reindeer sausages. The service was excellent. There are even a few outdoor small tables if you want to stop for a bit. Open 7 days a week and I highly recommend.",0
"Coffee and Dog treats kinda a thing in my ride. I usually tip if my pup gets a treat regardless the quality of the coffee. But this place has neither, no cookies, no good coffee. Seriously the coffee at the Green Store has better coffee! Maybe it wasn't ""Jenny"" today but doubt I'll be stopping through again.",0
"Most of the time, perfect! Some of the time excellent, and well... sometimes it's just better to make coffee at home. Short of a few inconsistencies, this place gets 5 stars, regardless of the inconsistencies. If I wanted strictly consistent, I suppose I'd go to a chain.",0
"Fast and delicious coffee! Super friendly baristas. Plenty of good snacks, and Alaska Reindeer Hot Dogs!",0
"Subpar latte. Milk was just above warm, not steamed.",0
The coffee is always hot and the eople are friendly. Sometimes a little slow though.,0
Convenient and quick.,2
Good little shop,2
Mostly soccer fields with a small playground and pavilion. Well maintained with a great view of the mountains and lots of open space.,0
Nice little park with a good playground for the littles!! Also a great spot to view the northern lights when its clear...,0
Dogs loved it. And it looks like other people are respectful with picking up after their dogs unlike other places.,0
Alaska wildlife is amazing,0
Very nice park VERY close to The Glen Highway and both Eagle River & Peter's Creek. Not the biggest or most exciting park I have ever been to but really nice and relaxing. Great for just getting out for a nice walk. Not very many people both times I have been.,0
Sweet little party. Have loved going there with my family over the years. Feels like home. Nice open field and a small playground plus a nice gazebo to sit under.,0
I love going there it is so fun it has a little playground and a soccer Field.,0
"Decent playground gear. Soccer fields are well maintained. Has a basketball court. Pavilion available, it can be reserved. Needs a swingset.",0
It's a park. Well maintained,0
Clean park clean bathrooms and nice crowd,0
On my way to a friends house,0

JT is amazing!! He does awesome work and VERY knowledgeable about the work he does.. Not finished yet cause I'm going to keep coming back!! Thanks JT ~KeKe~,0
"JT has been tattooing me for over 6 months now and he is always professional and does excellent work. Yeah you don't have to like all his music, but stick around because he does like Bach and Chopin too! I highly recommend going here, it is well worth the time and money invested.",0
"Clean and inviting shop. JT is extremely knowledgeable, professional, and skilled in the services he provides. Have an idea or ideas on the kind of art you want? Go in and see him today! Best shop in town hands down!",0
"Wife and I got tattoos to commemorate our honeymoon in Fairbanks. Loved the vibe of the shop, JT was really friendly and had very helpful suggestions re: the direction of my piece and it all came together great. Super fun to talk to and did amazing work, we're both really satisfied with the quality. He knocked out both of our pieces fast but they don't look rushed at all.",0
"Dope artist, dope work, friendly and clean environment! Always welcoming and open to your ideas!",0
I am two sessions into a half sleeve and the work truly speaks for itself.,0
"Clean, professional, and talented staff. My favorite tattoo I've received so far.",0
One session so far and I couldn't be more excited to go back for more. The quality you will receive and the pride that JT takes in his work is unparalleled in Fairbanks.,0
Jeff is the owner of this tattoo parlor and my wife and I only go to him for our artwork. You won't find a better artist in all of Fairbanks,0
"Great guy, good prices, awesome tattoo.",0
"Talk about down to earth. My daughter turned me on to this place. Jeremy (owner) up front and too the point. Had some tires mounted and balanced. I honestly didn't know they were at this location. His team did what most in the Fairbanks area wouldn't do, mount tires that were not purchased from his business. So North Pole, stop waisting your time and miles with the ""big guys"" in Fairbanks. Dropped off in morning, picked up in the afternoon.",0
Excellent customer service. Easy to work with and honest service. Highly recommend!,0
Great mechanics that brought my truck back to life. Honestly my truck runs better than it ever had. Jeremy took the time to educate us on diesel maintenance and now my friends are making appointments with him.,0
Awesome folks great work .I would recommend this place .I was treated with respect and was willing to work around my busy work schedule for the drop off and pick up of my vehicle. Something you don't see much of these days.,0
"They do know diesels, if you own a diesel this needs to be your shop. And they do good on anything else... A 6.0 specialist for sure!",0
"They have a well informed staff. I was always told the truth, will always trust HQ auto with my vehicle repair as welll as my daughters repair, finally a true word",0
Great trusted service.,2
Jeremy knows his way around a diesel for sure,0
Loved this place. Rained the whole time but they supplied us with fire wood and we had a great time.,0
Not a good place for family camping. Great of you are looking for fly fishing,0
"Bring your bug spray. This state campground is near the water and in the woods. After a good rain the mosquitos will carry you away . Tent camp sites are located in wooded areas. RV sites are a shared parking lot that can be cramped, lack of privacy, and difficult to back into. Has all the typical State park features, drop box for camping fee, pit latrines, walking paths. Dogs require leashes.",0
"Love it! Minus the mosquitos, but that's the Alaska way. :)",0
Nice place to camp,0
"Tony Knowles coastal trail is a popular place to walk, ride a bike and roller blade. On a clear day, Denali can be seen in the distance. An eleven mile bike ride from West 2nd Avenue to Kincaid Chalet. Vhuntermassage LLC",0
I love this is so beautiful,0
I'm surprised there aren't a lot more murders here,0
Having a great adventure and meeting wonderful people's. This is a great place to visit and looking forward to many more sites to visit and see. Stay tune.,0
The food is delicious and you have free laundry. Customer service is awful definitely the girls that are in the kitchen. Super rude but other than that I feel like good service,0
"This building is employee housing during the summer months and also serves as an Inn during the winter. It is true that it is old and a little run down. They have made a few attempts to spruce up the place. A lot of the staff here are nice and willing to work with you, if you are reasonable as well. They serve three full meals a day at their employee dining room, Mrs. B's. The public is welcome in the Outpost Bar and Grill which has a limited menu and bar. The scenery is what makes this place nice. It might not be a 5 star residence, but it's livable!",0
Great place to stay if you have to,0
It is a great place to live if you have no choice on lodging,0
"This area is located in Healy, Alaska about 15 miles north of the entrance to Denali National Park. Homestead is employee housing who work for HAP. Holland America Princess cruise lines.",0
Nice rooms and food!,0
"Growing up, this church was the place to be, and still is..Praise God..There is a lake about 1/2 mile North, an that lake was used by Pastor Wardese. (In-correct spelling perhaps), to land his single-engine plane. One of the first missionaries to come to the top..4/18/2019,,JP",0
"The pastor really seems to care for his congregation and the community. Coming from a nondenominational background, a little hard to adjust to hymnals. Got distracted by the word ""thot"" in the hymnal, ðŸ˜‚.",0
Amazingly beautiful location. Wonderful place to bring kids and dogs.,0
Birch hill in the summer is a great place to walk with kids because the trails r large with various lengths and lots of maps. We love coming here. Its not usually super busy though we see soccer clubs and weddings happen here periodically. There is a lot of room though so we have never had a problem sharing the trails,0
Love the black loop n high road trails.. Havent been through the disc golf course yet but looks fun. Dont be afraid to come out n explore. Well maintained with beautiful trees,0
Great place to run and bike in winter and a even better place to cross country ski in the winter,0
"Took my baby with some friends to watch them play disc golf and the hike was amazing, they had just fixed a couple of bad wash outs so it was just perfect for us to get around.",0
"Great local outdoors experience, hills and trees.",0
Birch Hill has some of the best trails in the state!,0
Nice summer place to walk lots of hills.,0
For skiing or as a venue Birch Hill is always 5/5!,0
The stylist was very friendly and did great work on my daughter she gfs hair.,0
"Really good, she was able to get me in short notice, the price was a bit higher then Iâ€™m used to. But the hair cut was fast and it came out looking really good. Iâ€™ll go back to her the next time I need a cut, my advice for the future though is to make an appointment a few days in advance.",0
"So for being inside Walmart these ladies do an amazing job. And the price is so affordable, it's like down in the lower 48. So be sure to tip big and come early, they book up fast!",0
"Always Friendly, Ashley was always a pleasure to see and have cur my hair.",0
"Staff are super friendly and get back to my needs in a timely manner :) I have never had a bad cut through them. Ashley has done my past several cuts and she has always done a fantastic job. All in all, pretty happy customer.",0
Difficult to get in because they're understaffed and only take same-day appointments (which is why I took a star off). But the prices are really low and the stylists do really good work. So for the price range their service is superior.,0
"They're either not open when the sign says they should be, or they say they're booked for the day. 6 times I've tried. Usually one person working, one customer and no one waiting. Huh???",0
"Friendly, affordable haircuts. Appointment almost required, they take salons if they aren't booked up.",0
"They are okay, but made my hair shorter than asked for because they were distracted by the phone.",0
"I was referred to Katmai Eye and Vision Center by a colleague. She said they really gave time to give her a thorough exam. I went yesterday and it's true. My total time spent in the office was an hour and half. I suffer with dry eyes and they gave me samples to try and told me, ""don't worry if this doesn't work we have another level we can go up!"" I am going back for a follow-up in 30 days. Yes, they a little expensive and they don't bill insurance; however, it's totally worth the expense. If you are looking for a through and highly professional eye and vision center, then Katmai is your place. I highly recommend!",0
top notch eye care and facility with state of the art equipment. friendly all around,0
"On-time, professional, and thorough.",0
"Dr. Leftner and staff are very welcoming, knowledgeable and excellent. I've been going to this eye center for just over a year now and I highly recommend!",0
I had a very pleasant experience. The staff was friendly and professional and Dr. Laura was able to help me right away. The facility is also very comfortable.,0
"Knowledgeable, friendly and extremely informative. They go above and beyond most typical eye exams. You will understand how your eyes really work and how you can improve and protect your eye health.",0
"This is a really cool office with first class doctors and staff. The exam was very comprehensive, and I liked the fact that they took their time; it wasn't an assembly line experience. They carry really modern frames and the very best lenses. I ended up buying Zeiss DriveSafe lenses, and they really are amazing. Very noticeable step up from the cheap stuff I had been wearing before. Highly recommend this place. First class experience all the way.",0
Very knowledgeable. On time! Friendly!,0
Very caring and friendly the staff and the doctors are very knowledgeable. Would highly recommend!,0
"As always, excellent service and professionalism.",0
Very knowledgable doctors and staff. Efficient and welcoming.,0
"I absolutely loved my experience with Hair Stylist and make up artist Stephanie, she was definitely amazing. Very professional and my natural look make up, came out very good. Everybody loved it. Thank you so much Stephanie it was definitely an experience. ***DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED***",0
"The outside doesn't look like much, but inside is a treasure. These ladies have created a wonderful, clean, good vibes kind of place. Natalie trimmed my hair and just went above and beyond by washing and then straightening it too. She really listened to the ideas I had for my hair and made me comfortable during my time there. I look forward to getting my hair trimmed now and highly recommend Charlotte Rouge to any poor souls looking to put life back into their hair.",0
It's a beautiful place. But when you are only getting a trim and it costs 75 dollars that's a bit much. I didn't feel special or treated like you would at a salon more like if you are new and not spending 300 to get color then you don't get full service only have at a New York salon price. With no known name stylist. Also when I got there they didn't even seat me with the person I was suppose to see. But hey the lady that did my hair was going to Hawaii for 10 days. Guess with prices like that it's easy. Never again with their customer service no matter how pretty it is.,0
"I absolutely love this place. The gals are super friendly, no high brow attitudes. I have to budget for a visit but it is absolutely worth every bit.",0
"Used to go regularly go to a few other salons in town and as soon as I gave in and tried Charlotte Rouge, I never went back. They are always consistent and never disappoint. I had platinum blonde hair and that's something hard for a lot of salons to accomplish, they told me I'd have to trim a little bit to achieve the color I wanted. They are realistic and honest about what they can do without damage to the hair. 10/10",0
I love this salon! It's beautiful & Natalie always does an amazing job on my hair.,0
"The only salon I will go to for anything. I feel very welcomed and comfortable. My hairdresser is Jessica, and I love it when she does my hair. She continues the conversation, and actually asks me questions. I walk out feeling so great, not only about my hair but having someone to talk to is great. Being a stay at home mom, you get what you can lol.",0
This is the best salon in Fairbanks. Great customer service. I always walk out looking like a million bucks.,0
They do an amazing job at cutting and dying hair.,0
They r amazing I love this place ðŸ˜,0
No longer does wedding updos,0
Beautiful spa with exceptional service,0
Just had family pictures taken which included our two dogs.. Megan up front was helpful and very nice while Michael who took our pictures was amazing as well. They took the time to look through all options with us and even retake a few pictures when I didn't like how I looked! Great customer service!,0
We took pictures on 11/6/2020 for our son's third birthday we feel we was rushed thru our session which lasted only 10 minutes she wasn't patience with my son and it took 7days to receive our digital pictures and most of the pictures was duplicates family before us the tool there time with them maybe cause we was a black family we get this done every year and we was charged $5.00 because of Covid-19 it's not our fault cause Covid-19 is here so why did we get charged for this and we was given a $25.00 card that the manager told us we couldn't use we was more disappointing we get our son's pictures done every year and there's something disappointing every time,0
I had been going there since my daughter was 1 month old because they had wonderful staff that were truly talented. NOW it's extremely unorganized and with employees that cannot fulfill simple requests for capturing precious moments.,0
"Worst service, very disorganized. Waited for few hours to take photos, I'm not returning here.",0
Popular place to hold parties. Parking lot is small but it's a quick walk from the surrounding neighborhoods.,0
Eat play and fetch. All in one at a time...,0
Nice quiet place to bring the family!,0
"The drainage of the sand pit is pitiful! It looks like a lake. The handicap swing is facing the wrong way! It should look into the park. One bench is facing toward someone's yard, instead of the playground. The walrus rock is blocking the view from the other bench. It lacks a natural flow. I would like to see more benches added. Thank you!",0
With the hustle and bustle of Anchorage all around this is a lovely space for our 5-12 year old kids to run and play.,0
Fun jungle gym and climbing frame. There is also a sandpit and a large green area for the kids to play,0
Fun for all ages!!,0
Worked very well with a time crunch that I had. They were very professional. They did a great job and I love the late night key box that you can pick up from!,0
Overpriced. I only had a wheel bearing go out and they told me I needed to replace almost my whole frontend. 631 dollars to replace the wheelebearing . And they told me it was Gunnar be almost 5500 bux to get me vehicle road ready. Drove my truck home and all is fine. So I do not recommend this shop,0
"It's so nice to find a shop that's friendly, honest, AND knows what they're doing. They do amazing work here, even when the job turns out to be more complicated than expected.",0
Fast and accurate diagnosis of my truck's problems. Made several repairs all in one day. Perfect wheel alignment done; the truck tracks very straight. Explained remaining problem with power steering. Honored parts warranty.,0
"Hands down, one of the best automotive shops Iâ€™ve ever stepped foot in. I just happened to be in Fairbanks for a few days and found out my drive back to the Wasilla/Anchorage area was going to be a little difficult. This is my first winter navigating the Parks and Richardson highways so I decided it was probably best to get my summer tires changed out. Iâ€™ve never had winter tires but the overwhelming recommendation from friends has been to go with Blizzaks. I called 5 or 6 places before coming across the Front End Shop. Not only were they able to find the tires to fit my vehicle, they somehow magically managed to squeeze me in less than 36 hours later, during changeover season!! Leo and Cindy were so incredible. I canâ€™t thank them enough. And they did such a wonderful job. My drive home was nerve wracking but I felt so much better knowing they had taken care of me. Thank you!",0
Not too pleased overall. But they do have courtesy shuttle service which is helpful,0
Super friendly staff! I really feel like I'm treated like family when I do business here!,0
Excellent customer service here. Very knowledgeable staff.,0
"Little pricey, but good people and they know what they're doing.",0
I will chance this after we see how they do on fixing my jeep.,0
They are completely booked up.,0

Top notch motor repair.,0

Awesome place to get you boating needs resolved!,0

Great family run business Gary and Tony and Bonnie are the greatest thanks for the great experience,0
"Fast and friendly, good work. This is my family's go-to shop in Fairbanks.",0
Well let's face it kind of seem like nice guys but I think they're getting a little old in there days because but the high overcharging and kind of have an attitude in the grand business little awkward,0

Helpful and friendly staff. They had my truck running when I got there and swept it out before I left.,0
"They helped me to get my uhal u box rental that I had shipped from Vancouver Wa to Fairbanks Ak set up on their trailer. But they charged me an extra month for the u box , I agreed to pay with the understanding that I would get a refund for the remaining 25 days of the one month rental....the online uhaul will not give me a refund for the 25 days left that I turned In the ubox on the trailer!ðŸ˜¤ I am only giving them a 3 â­ because my stuff arrived in perfect shape and nothing broken. That is thanks to my sister packing it very well. Uhaul on Airport way should be giving me a refund for 25 days!ðŸ˜¤",0
"I have had no problems at all at this location, compared to other locations. Super helpful, quick, and always open on time. Highly recommend this location.",0
Prices and services are great. Nice having a second store for trailer rental. Moving my work tool box has been easy with the low ramp trailer.,0
Only return location for my review. Two folks working at the time. Very polite. Reasonably knowledgeable. Plenty of supplies in stock. Clean restrooms.,0
"The staff is very limited having only one or two people on duty at a time, so wait times can get long, but they are friendly and helpful. The interior of the store also feels very cramped, but it looks like the layout is temporary, so overall 4 stars",0
Check out their towing section. Great prices for a lot of really useful stuff,0
Took them almost an hour just to give me the keys to one of their vans,0
I work here.,2
Best staff in town,0
amazing staff was clean everyone was wearing masks made me feel comfortable my hair not only looks amazing feels amazing as well,0
Nice staff quality cuts. Will return,0
"I love this place. I've been in twice now and have gotten amazing service each time. The head of the shop (I think her name is tamara) is amazing and extra helpful to my wife and I. (My wife has a unique hair situation)...as long as we live in anchorage, we will only get our hair cut here.",0
"My hair was brassy orange from self coloring and I hated it. Tamra totally fixed me up. I love my hair and the cut. Got dark tones underneath and it fades toto light on top. It's always scary to use a new stylist, but I am so glad I went here. (Abbott store) thank you ladies! I want to post my before and after but can't find an option ðŸ˜.",0
Great prices friendly service excellent cuts styles colors perms and they now have $16.50 on Tuesdays,0
"I went there to get the underneath of my hair done in neon orange and it took five hours. I understand that my hair was dark, but not dark enough for it to have taken 5 hours. Also it was way to expensive for what the quality of work represented. I recommend going somewhere the price matches the quality.",0
"I had been looking for someone who understood what i wanted, and i was at Fredmeyer & decided to give this Perfect Look a try, and im so glad i did , i found Violet & she listened to what i said i wanted & she is the someone ive been looking for & so close to home, im very happy",0

"Friendly staff, got steamers for the kids and treat for our dog. Good coffee too.",0

We were out of state and Jake with the Dar Walden team made it seamless in the sale process and kept us informed. He helped us clean out the home and made sure repairs were completed since we were not there to oversee the process. Very happy with this experience and would recommend the Dar Walden team again.,0
"Big thank you to Regina and this team for helping us buy our first home! Along the way they answered our heaps of questions without hesitation and happily guided us through the entire experience, in which we were very green. When things got tough (with the pandemic) they did their best and worked through many adversities. We really appreciated the avid use of electronic documents and professional services in order to adhere to all the safety guidelines.",0

"I've been going to Josette's for 6 or 7 years. She is reliable, priced right, patient and does a great cut.",0
Shes great with kids,0
Josette is amazing she did a wonderful Deva cut for me and let my hair so curly!!,0
Been seeing Josette for many many years. She's the only one I let touch my hair.,0
"Josette is so nice,cheap and quick!!",0
Beautiful trail. It is not super hard. And it has Beautiful views of the river.,0
Lots of hidden history and adventure to be found. Shady trees form a long tunnel of trees down a lengthy trail. I have not yet reached the end on foot with two kiddos in tow.,0
"Nice, quiet relatively flat out and back walk. Steep access to river at east end. Limited street parking",0
Nice and easy out and back,0
This is a nice little trail thatâ€™s easily accessible and goes on a long ways for those willing to do a little bit of scrambling a mile or so in where a rock slide exists. Parking for this trail can be achieved at the end of N Valley Way just before it intersects E Eagle Avenue. A 3 minute walk leads one to a bluff viewing spot of the Matanuska River bed and then parallels the river along an old overgrown railroad track that used to transport coal from the Sutton coal mines into the town of Palmer. Wonderful views of the River valley along the way!,0
Nice evening walk.,2
Beautiful lawn strip for dog walking that provides dogipot bags and bins. The main trail goes a long the river that can be a little rough for my bad ankle.,0
"Provides convenient service for South Douglas residents, beach goers and fueling the boat for South Douglas fishing departures.",0
"Decently priced gas, relatively clean outside (nice paint job), squeegee are twice the width of the bucket they're supposed to fit in. The bucket water is smells like sewer and is almost empty. Gross. Also no outdoor napkins.",0
"Finally! This place is extremely convenient for Douglas dwellers. Grocery side is way overpriced, but you'd expect that at any convenience store in Juneau. Beer and Liquor prices seem fine though.",0
The only place you can get gas in the downtown area after hours?!,0
The guy didn't know anything,0
"24 hour cardlock gas station. Used to be a quickie mart that sold hostess twinkees and soda pop, but not anymore.",0
currently self-serve/credit card only,0
Its dead now want till the summer,0
hey homeboy on the corner over there by the gardens got a little ten-by-ten set up and selling BBQ food made southern-style it was delicious it was so good go get yourself a plate 5 7 10 and 12 $20 whatever you got he'll hook you up but you got to go check it out.,0
The Gardens at Bragaw is a community garden. Great place to teach your kids about gardening and sharing.,0
Pretty awesome that the community has a place like this for people to grow their own food. I'd like to check it out and find out more about it.,0
Get phone # have a spot to grow your garden community garden,0
"Lowest prices on fuel. Great customer rewards program. If you haven't already signed up, I strongly suggest you do. It seems like I get great perks every time I go there.",0
Every time I go there their service is friendly and the store looks good.,0
Itâ€™s nice but service could be so much better,0
"Been going to this wonderful place for 3 years now & counting! Never disappoints! The barbers here make you feel right at home; depending on what season of sports is currently going on, most likely it will be on while getting your haircut! Fair Prices on haircuts as well!! If I had to recommend a barber there at this location (even tho they are all great barbers) it would be Miguel! Cheers to next time gentlemen! Lusiano Lucky-De Coronado",0
Super friendly environment and they cut pretty good too.,0
I got a fantastic haircut and a shave for $25,0
"Great barbershop and they gave me a pretty clean lineup, would recommend any locals to go here! ðŸ˜ðŸ‘Œ",0
Called ask if they where available in 10 mins for a haircut they said yes. Walked in 4 customers waiting with only 1 barber working. I'm not about to wait a hour after just calling never coming back,0
Best in town!,2
They do not WORK on women's hair,0

Rated medium as not to disrupt the ratings too much but this location appears to not be open right now. You can not access the mall interior and the phone is disconnected,0
Pretty good pho,2
"Amazing food. This place is tucked away in the Northway Mall (which is pretty creepy and vacant these days) but itâ€™s worth the trip. The food comes out hot and fast and is delicious. If you donâ€™t mind trekking through what looks like a post-apocalyptic shopping mall, this place will not disappoint you.",0
The pho wasn't meaty enough and lacked flavor. The peppered steak was all peppers and barely any steak. The egg rolls were tiny and expensive and lacked flavor. 10 out of ten would not recommend. I'm going to have to stick with phoNatik for future pho orders they never disappoint,0
"This was my first time ordering from Pho Lena Express. I've always loved Pho Lena. I ordered the lao style larb, chicken satay and a bbq pork steam bun. The steam bun was pork, not bbq pork and pretty bland. The larb was super salty, so much that I couldn't eat it. I ordered chicken larb but it was either ground pork or ground chicken, yuck. And the satay was dry with very water peanut sauce. I will not be ordering from Pho Lena Express again. Super disappointing.",0
The potstickers are very lacking never had one this skinny like they were running out of filler the taste is good but mostly fried dough i also ordered shrimp fried rice paid 3 extra for sticky rice and extra fir shrimp got a box of rice with 5 shrimp and some fried onions had this delivered no utensils no napkins and no soy sauce ...,0
"Great food and service. Tucked away, and I like it that way.",0
Great place for a quick bite!,0
absolutely great customer service! most scrumptious food! definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone ; ),0
I have to say I'm very disappointed in how little meat there was in my pho combination that I ordered yesterday... When I got home to heat up my food to eat I actually thought it was only soup broth no meat because all of it was in bottom of bowl and there was only 8 tiny pieces of meat and the laab that I ordered wasn't even good barely enough too and to think I even tipped them... I will not be going back to this restaurant ever again they need to make sure there's enough meat per order if they want satisfied customers to keep coming back and giving them a good rating I would've rated no stars if I could this was truly a disappointment save your money and order from another pho restaurant if you want What you paid for...which is plenty and good food!! Not here!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
Best pho in town hands down.,0
I love this place. I comega here so much they know my order by heart. The owner is amazing and very friendly.,0
Phone was pretty good. Unlike other places they actually give a fair amount of pho.,0
Always a delicious meal!,0
"Never disappointing foods great, service is poor",0
The super bowls of pho is amazing.,0
Oh SO ðŸ˜‹. Good service. Friendly!,0
So delighted and delicious,0
It's okay food. Place is a bit gloomy.,0
Awesome Vietnamese food and Thai food,0
It's the Moonshine shop..what's not to love?,0
"This place is great. HUGE camp sites complete with tables, fire pits, and a grill great. The camper parking is nice, they have a concrete bump stop to keep you from going to far into the site. This sometimes makes it hard to get near you table, but it is on a site by site basis. DOG FRIENDLY. And easy access to the river. Finally, you still have LTE service here.",0
Quick and campground area was neat and tidy. Neighbors were wonderful.,0
"Nice, peaceful public picnic spot along the river.",0
"Clean, level, with a great fireplace.",0
Love this area!,2
Nice campground that usually fills up.,0

We love to stop at the Alaskan Historical Monuments when we are near. We learn so much from the pioneers of past. They truly paved the ways of where we are today. Keep our past history alive!!,0
Itâ€™s very sad to see how much graffiti and damage has been done to this place. I know they keep on top of it But the vandalism is getting out of control.,0
"Nice opportunity to learn the history of the founding of Fairbanks. Plenty of parking and a nice, short walk on a paved path.",0
This is a great place to go gold mining and rock hounding.,0
"Felix Pedro On July 22, 1902 In the Creek Opposite Here Made The First Discovery Of Gold In The Fairbanks District Dedicated By Pioneers of Alaska Igloo No. 4 July 22, 1952 Felice Pedroni Locally Known As Felix Pedro Born Fanano Italy Apr. 16, 1858 Died Fairbanks, Alaska July 22, 1910 The monument is located at a pull off from the Steese Highway across from Discovery Creek where he found the gold which led to the development of Fairbanks and the gold rush to Fairbanks in 1902.",0

"VERY NICE FRONT DESK PERSON, GINNY YOU ROCK. WAS ABLE TO GET PAPERWORK NOTARIZED AND SUBMITTED WITH EASE AND QUICKLY. OH, AND THE KEURIG MACHINE DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED, THE COFFEE WAS AWESOME.",0
A top-of-the-line ANCSA Corporation that puts fish first and values their shareholders.,0
Helpful and responsive. Friendly and patience with questions and concerns.,0
Nice clean well maintained.,0
Love how they take care of us.,0
Hard to get sit done here there to bussy keeping there pockets lined with the people's money rather then doing right by them!,0
Great corporation to work for,0
They are understanding and friendly.,0
Awesome crew. I walked in and they were able to accommodate me. They did an excellent job diagnosing what the issue was and did not try to overcharge. I highly recommend DC 907!,0
We got some work done to our truck & they were awesome. We have plans to go back for some other modifications in a few months as well. We'll continue to use these guys for sure!,0
Very knowledgeable mechanics!,2
"Made an appointment with these guys for a diagnostic due to a bit of sputtering on a Duramax. Brought the truck in a week later for the appointment time. After a day and a half I called them and was told they just got it in the shop. ( Defeats the reason for making appointments). After 5 days still nothing. Showed showed up at 2:00 on the following Monday and the place was locked up and no one there. The receptionist showed up and I got my truck and left. There was no communication on their part. Brought this truck in to test them out for a simple diagnosis . They made nothing. And lost out on a lot of future accessories, repairs, and upgrades that we were gonna have them do on a few other pieces of equipment if they turned out to be a competent shop . If your looking to ""Roll Coal"" which is fine and don't mind waiting for who knows how long for them to get to it regardless of appointment times then use these guys. If your looking for dependable, prompt, competent diesel service don't take it here.",0
Long turn times. Job is done correctly. Honest service,0
907 just does a great job.,0
"They were great to work with. Helpful, patient, and efficient. And we've been very happy with the trailer so far!",0
"Chris at the Wasilla location made the sale, true professional. The North Pole location is also a good group of professionals. Overall customer service is top notch at White Spruce Trailers.",0
The guys at White Spruce are great! They make the buying process very quick and easy.,0
Helpful and friendly workers,0
Chris in Wasilla is the ultimate professional. He went above and beyond for me today in the purchasing process of my new trailer.,0
"Very happy with the experience, staff was very helpful and friendly. Answered my questions and didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need or want. I would recommend White Spruce to my friends. Because they weren't pushy and listened ,answered my questions, made recommendations based on my questions and needs.",0
Great customer service. Very knowledgeable,0
I give 5 stars for variety of trailers available. I did not purchased anything yet but will visit again. Good pricing and helpful staff.,0
They had s trailer we needed to borrow. It worked out well.,0
"Very friendly, knowledgeable service.",0
"Excellent service, knowledgeable about what I needed, even when I wasn't sure how to describe the issue, patient, and willing to work with you to help you understand how to fix problems. 10/10 would recommend for your DIY projects.",0
"Mooresâ€™ is a staple in TKA. They are super friendly and if they are out of stock on something, they are helpful and open to try and get it on their next delivery.",0
"Very clean compared to the other local store. Friendly and willing to help when you walk in with something that needs fixed. Easy to get to shelfâ€™s. Open and flowing floor plan. Bright with lots of lights. They also have free pop corn. Only knew of the other store when we first moved, it is a health hazard. Once we found this place we have only shopped here, unless of corse they break my heart and donâ€™t have the stove pipe piece I need. That always sucks.",0
Helpful staff. Most everything you'd need. They can also order most anything and get it within a few days.,0
I always have good luck at this store getting the parts we need for emergency repairs!,0
"Staff is very helpful and friendly. Prices can be a bit on the expensive side, but what can you expect in small town Alaska.",0
"Very helpful staff, professional. Has a bit of everything you need for do it yourself projects and home improvement.",0
A little bit of everything,0
Wife and I love working out here. No judgements zone here,0
"This Women's Club is very good, especially if you prefer a female-only, small gym experience. Plus, I love that it has a hot tub, sauna, and steam room for relaxation and recovery. The staff are very personable and helpful, and the equipment is kept clean. The only major negative thing is that you have to purchase a Gold Membership, which is quite pricey, and sign a one year contract to go here.",0
"Great place to workout, lots of choices in equipment to choose from for different fitness levels.",0

Great gallery. Lots of unique items for gift giving.,0
"Wonderful shop with local and regional arts, crafts, & souvenirs. Something for every taste.",0
They are nice.. helpful,0
Amazing Cafe! Stopped on my roadtrip to meet a friend here; the owner was friendly and happy to answer some questions about coffee. Great local place!,0
"I had savored the taste and sight of the fresh made biscuits, eggs, sausage and gravy, but I did not like the excessive calories of my breakfast meal. I chose to walk the entire length of the Spit, then continued walking to burn the calories. On the corner of Main Street and Sterling Highway, I saw a huge red cup that sells caffeine. I met the soulful owner, we shared thoughts. He suggested to visit Seldovia or Norman Lowell Gallery or Halibut Cove. (I managed to take a ferry to Seldovia and I drove to the Gallery ) After drinking the energetic beverage, I continued to walk on Main Street to cross Sterling Highway. I did not feel tired and I enjoyed the area by Bishop Beach, then back to Sterling Highway to walk on the bicycle/ pedestrian paved trail to Land Ends Resort. I believe that I walked at least 13 miles. CoffeSmith gave me the opportunity to continue to burn the calories by walking and photographing my Homer memories versus taking a cab back to the resort.",0
Awesome little coffee spot. My now go-to place for when I am out and about. Having a half-sweet hazelnut mocha with coconut milk now. Perfect ðŸ‘Œ,0
"Stopped this morning, guy was really nice and coffee was exceptionally delicious! Breakfast burrito was good too.",0
Best in town,2

"Save your money and make your own sandwich. Stale bread, old wilted ingredients, really bad, no ownership pride at this place",0

"So done with the Anchorage branch of Vital Statistics. You wait on hold for the estimated time, and then it just boots you back to the main menu and the back of the line with a new, longer wait time. Rinse and repeat.",0
Fast experience. Nice individuals that were helpful,0
"Had four counters but only one person working, but she was still doing an encredibly fast job! Another counter finally opened after the line got too long, and she was very knowledgeable in everything we asked and even told us more information we didn't know about! Awesome! Just a little time consuming but still great!",0
Getting birth certificate was fast and easy no complications,0

"Iâ€™ve been dependent on FedEx Office locations around the country for every imaginable printing need. Iâ€™ve been coming to this location for nearly 25 years (back when they were all Kinkoâ€™s). The offerings and services have increased over the years and they really are equipped to handle most any job you need taken care of while being able to accommodate all of your shipping needs as well. If you arenâ€™t certain what type of gift to give for a holiday or special occasion they are a great place to turn your photos into special keepsakes. Their staff is attentive, knowledgeable and friendly and they are always willing to help with suggestions. They are open from 7-10 on weekdays, so donâ€™t worry about deadlines and rush orders...they will take great care of you!",0
"I've used computers and printed documents here since the '90s. I've generally been able to get whatever I need. If you need assistance, there is usually a wait but that's to be expected. I rarely have an unreasonable wait time. Most tasks you can do yourself. They were one of the first print shops equipped with USB and phone options to print directly without using their computers. I do wish, however, that this location would get up on the FedEx printing website. I've had numerous issues with using that website to print documents to this location. Most recently, the location doesn't even show up anymore as an option. would be nice to be able to order ahead online and be able to pick up my documents later without having to do it over the phone.",0
Jake was very helpful and professional. He helped us get PDFs printed and stayed late to get it done. He actually said that he would stay until we were done. A1 customer service. His tech knowledge was top notch. Unbelievably customer centered service. If Jake is not a manager he should be. A real talent.,0
I just shipped 2 oversized boxes and the whole process was great. Every team member worked together to make sure it worked out! I canâ€™t say enough. I will definetly be back for any of my shipping needs.,0
"I had to print a simple return label, their print email wouldn't accept it. I waited in line for help, 1 woman helped the man behind me, and the other 2 women were helping the same customer. They have me another email address to send the label to, then I had to wait for the 2 women to continue helping another person.",0
"I have had a few things printed here, not to bad. had to use the pay by the minute computer. can get pricey fast not so bad for quick jobs thought.",0
"Fast service, quality products, professional people.",0
They are supposed to close at 8:00 pm and I am here 6:46 and it is closed with light on and people,0
"If you package has more than 20 pounds of weight, please bring lots of money",0
The guy is clueless and they can't help you print a file,0
Awesome car wash,2
Amazing service. Only place I'll ever take my vehicles . Can't compare to any machine .,0
Only reason it's not a 5 star is on occasion they miss a spot or two and use a dirty rag to dry off the windows and leave streaks. Tips do help. Great service always. There interior work has always been top notch.,0
"My favorite! Tip them well they deserve it! Update August 8 2018: They are ""upgrading"" The guys that work here are still doing an AWESOME job with the hand washing and drying!",0
I've used their carwash and detail since 1996. It is still my go to for a quick and concise job well done.,0

Best place for everything you need in the kitchen in town! Really fun store to just browse!,0
This is really an amazing store for cookware etc. Its unfortunate its closing so the owners can retire. I wish someone would buy and run it.,0

"The sales people were really nice and helpful, and the bed I bought is amazing but... they gave me the wrong sized mattress and when I went to exchange it for the right one(the smaller size. I wanted the full not the queen) the lady didn't believe me, and made me stack the mattresses on top of each other before we could leave, so that she could see the size difference with her own eyes",0
Courteous customer service. Knowledgeable employee on store products which aided my purchase. Two thumbs up for Kim!,0

"This is where I go to get my plans printed. They can also digitize your paper documents. I recently had them digitize almost 200 pages of mixed format plans and they did it in like 2 hours. The prints weren't even in good condition, I was surprised they were able to do it so quickly.",0
I had a topographic map printed here. Fair price and a ton of options. Great service and lots of parking,0
Love these guys and they always do a great job. Go Cowboys!,0

"Fantastic meat, produce and service reasonably priced!!",0
"Great sandwiches at the deli, and the frozen yogurt machine was a neat treat! Staff was friendly, and actually struck up a conversation, which you don't always see in the big cities. While the prices are a bit high, I am pretty sure its the norm for the region.",0

My favorite place.,2
Friendly and helpful.,2
Open till 11 pm on Sunday great booze good people to help you find exactly what you need for your personal buzz,0
"Alright for ghetto keg. Girl wouldn't accept a whopping $11 in quarters, said I had to go to the coinstar (which charges a percentage and is in the main building). Had to put it on a card because she was too lazy to watch me do her job for her. Also, there was a free meth pipe in the parking lot, but I stomped on it- sorry local tweakers",0
They have booze,2
Good prices for spirits,0
Best variety of wines anchorage,0
Fair prices for Fairveiw,0
Responsible people who care,0
Employees are burnt out_,0
Great views here. Nice walk from downtown. It smells weird sometimes.,0
A very nice place to go and relax,0
Awesome little inlet. Great views. Dangerous Tides! Check the signs!,0
Nice place to view Anchorage downtown.,0
Good views good for tourist,0
Small is what it means. No wait usually and you better have a tide book. Once the tide is fully out your difficulty getting your boat out of the water is slim. A place to walk around and pole fishing. 5.00 to park for the day and believe me they do check and it goes to a 40.00 dollar fine. Best to pay the 5.00. Lots of parking and restroom available if needed,0
This is a cool boat launch with lots of mud.,0
First tried launching my homemade boat there and went well,0
Love going down there and watching the sunset checking out the ocean levels and the ice Froze all up nice view of Sleeping Lady thank you guys you're such a lovely place,0
Cool place and view,0
"It's a boat launch, with a cool mini-park. it's Anchorage. Parking authority has the place sowed up. Beware of launching at low tide, ramp drops off. Great view of the inlet. A cool place to go sit and have a picnic.",0
Great place to visit and see the port and the mountains without the city to block your view. Kind of an odd way to get here but the views are worth it. Parking can be an issue when fish are running and it's not a paved road to get here.,0
A good place to look for whales seals and do some fishing,0
Spectacular views of the sunset. Fun fishing spot during the season.,0
"A place to remember. Great views of downtown, the mountains, the inlet!",0
A great place to watch the sun set,0
Where else can you go...,0
"NICE place, good to watch the sunset.",0
fun in the sun,0
Great boat launch.,2
Fishing is awsome,2
My dog loves coming here for daycare! The caregivers are so awesome there!! It makes a huge difference where you bring your pets because they are your family and that's exactly the way they treat your pets when you leave!! ðŸ˜,0
"Loved our experience. We called and were able to schedule a same day temperament test so our pup could have a doggie play date instead of having to stay in the hotel in his kennel. They were super sweet, helpful and he had a great time. They even had Frontline on hand for him to ensure that he wouldn't come home with any ""extra"" friends. This place is fantastic and we'll definitely be using them again on our next visit down from Fairbanks!",0
They always to an amazing job! Had to board our dog when we went on vacation. We knew they are in good hands! Dawn is the best!,0
Little dog looks great,0
The own is very unprofessional I wouldn't recommend this place witch is sad be the pup need homes,0
"Not only did they rescue my baby Star's momma, they take great care of Star during the day. The staff is helpful, friendly, and you can feel the love for all the dogs there!",0
Friendly kind staff. Dogs love it there,0
Shyanne is really nice and professional ðŸ˜Š,0
Super friendly. Looking to adopt a rescue there.,0
"Less than impressed with this dog day care and boarding facility. The facility itself is very nice and clean and the staff are welcoming, however, my dog has come here twice in the last 2 weeks and has contracted canine oral papilloma and a bite wound on his second visit. My dog has been going to daycare since he was 4-5 months old at another facility so he is very familiar with the setting. I thought we would try a new place and now I am disappointed that the Hound Lounge did not meet my expectations. I did not pick him up on the day the incident happened, but I came to the facility the following day and was told that him and another dog were just playing and there was not any aggression from my dog or the other. In fact, the lady I spoke to told me they were not quite sure what happened because he didn't cry or squeal; they just happened to see the wound. I understand that dogs play, but if they are being 100% supervised then there should be no reason for my dog to come home with a bite wound that almost goes through his entire cheek. Nonetheless, I was never called about the incident and I was just told to put some neosporin on it. I would give Hound Lounge another try, but after coming to the facility to clarify what happened, I was not given assurance by the staff member I spoke to that my dog will be in great hands at this facility. His bite wound is doing just fine and our vet said the warts should go away on its own, but as of right now my dog cannot go to daycare and socialize with other dogs until the warts are gone, which is a huge bummer because it is the only time he is able to hang out with other dogs and the vet said it could take up to 5 weeks until they go away. Hound Lounge may work out for other dogs and dog owners, but I would not recommend bringing your dog here.",0
We got our dog there. They have a lot of dogs up for adoption.,0
Nice and friendly staff. They treated my dog well. I like that they open earlier too.,0
They helped me adopt out my dogs when i was unable to provide for them.,0
Alaska Bully Rescue's Hound Lounge is an awesome place to take your dog for daycare. They actually care about the dogs they care for. I wouldn't trust anyone else with my fur baby.,0
"Was matched with the sweetest, best fitting dog here",0
"Closed down on the week-end, hard to ascertain information about the place. Wouldn't consider leaving the pooch here.",0
They offer a great service for bully breeds,0
"Neat place, dropping off a friends pup.",0
Great staff and very nice facility,0
The staff is amazing.,0
One of the best dog daycare in town,0
Amazing people â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,2
"This review is purely from the perspective of a former employee. I believe in what the agency tries to accomplish and their mission statement. However, this is by far one of the most discriminatory and self serving agencies I have ever worked for/with in my career. I believe a huge part of this is due to the small town mentality and being the only agency of its kind in Seward. The Board of Directors are clueless and in fact they are so behind the scenes that I met maybe 3 of them during my 6 years as an employee. The Executive Director does not separate her religious beliefs from her decision making. It's really a shame because there is so much potential for them to make a positive impact on the community but they need new management.",0
SeaView works very hard to provide plenty of services to Seward as well as individuals from all around Alaska.,0
Civil services for Seward citizens,0
"This is the place to go if youâ€™re not sure about beer. Thereâ€™s something on the menu for every taste, from dark & heavy mouthpunchers, to piney IPAs, to tangy sours, and even a soda-like Radler.",0
"Always a lovely stop at this place. Some of my favorite beers and has a great local grapefruit soda. Lovely view of the mountains from upstairs, with great local art decorating the place. They also play local music through the speakers there. If you're a fan of sours then you'd enjoy this stop. Friendly and outgoing staff.",0
"Small tasting room but big flavor! Had a great time there, beers were very good, lots of sours and a few belgian styles to choose from! No food there, but food truck pulls up in parking lot which was perfect",0
"If you find yourself thirsty , for a tasty refreshing local craft brew .. Then this is the spot ! Go in and say hi to Mary and have a beer , or 3 . Your an adult , pat yourself on the back , and enjoy .",0
"""Framb Was"" ;Sour;4.9% .. great beer! Always have one when we wait on our food from truck ""The backporch"".",0
Great beers and reasonably priced. Friendly atmosphere.,0
"For our family, hands down best beer in town. Owners are friendly and the beer delicuous! My wife develops a headache after drinking a beer, doesn't have that problem with Turnagain Brewing!! Great place filled with great people. Whenever we go they have some great rock music playing. Have plenty of seating down and upstairs. Check them out, good beer!",0
Great brews and atmosphere!,0
We loved their location and brews. The flight was reasonable in price and sitting upstairs was great.,0
I'm a fan of the Atlantic IPA!,0
They sell 4 oz glasses which are not cheap but I personally like the option of smaller beers if you want to taste more. Will go back to taste them all.,0
"Drive thru is finally not so long! Great experience!! Staff are very friendly, service is fast and the food is always right and delicious!",0
So ecstatic we have an Arby's! Great service and awesome food. My new lunch time go to place. Newly opened and line inside moves quick and efficient! Most definitely will be back!,0
"I ordered the Brisket Bacon Flatbread with Curly Fries. Sandwich was good, but smaller than pictured. Being brisket, I wished it were slaw instead of lettuce, and there was no tomato. However it was good nonetheless. Fries were hot and crispy. I will be returning, worth the long wait at the Drive-Thru.",0
Reuben was awesome w curly fries also....I love arby sauces....,0
I really like the food and the service was really fastðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© like I just paid and the food was out under 5 minutes! I hope they can keep put the good work!,0
Food was great. Waited about 15 minutes to order but being it was in it's grand opening that's not bad at all. Only complaint was they were sold out of the ham and cheese subs.,0
"They were very fast, accurate, and friendly. They had a huge line of cars for the drive-thru and a long line inside the store. We were in the back of the line and were inside maybe a total of 10 minutes. AWESOME JOB!!",0
"This place could teach Sonic how to operate, very busy but cranks out the food. And I love the beef and cheddar.",0
"Great food and service, quick to make order, not long to wait. Nice friendly window lady.",0
"The food is wonderful, and despite the line going out the door and the drive thru line going out to the safeway parking lot, I still got my food in less than 10 minutes. Good food and Fast service. Highly recommended.",0
Glad that fairbanks has another restaurant people are used to. Clean interior. Standard Arby's food. Fast service even with lots of people in the drive thru.,0
"So happy we finally have an Arby's in Fairbanks! The service is quick, and the food is great.",0
3rd time we have eaten here and the Food was great an so was the employee's,0
"To start with the positive, the food is hot and good when you get it. The negative is attempting to order your food is very difficult and there are frequent errors on the order.",0
Very over priced. Wasn't very good. Won't be going back.,0
So happy to have an Arby's in town now,0
Tasty... friendly staff,2
My food i was good,0
"They were on time, and did an excellent job! I will continue to use their services for my home, and will recommend them to anyone I know.",0
"The service and professionalism was top-notch, he got stains and pet odor out of my carpet that I had given up on. He went out of his way to explain the cleaning process to me and helped me make sure I can keep the pet odor away if my dog has any future accidents. I will recommend this place to anyone looking to get their carpets cleaned. If you have pet odor do yourself a favor and get the enzyme treatment it'll save you a headache in the long run",0
"Did a great job on carpet that had paint overspray on it. Came earlier than scheduled and completed job quickly, but properly.",0
What a difference! Heavy traffic stains and pet odors all gone. Very friendly and accommodating. No hidden fee. Fast professional service. So glad we found them!,0
Very helpful and knowledgeable. Willing to work with you and your needs.,0
"Great service, professionalism and reasonable pricing.",0
"Bobby Hurst and crew are top notch professionals. They cleaned carpets that were stained by several years of animals and kids making messes all over the house. The pet odor and most stains simply disappeared after they completed the job. Thanks for your true customer service and communication with us. Keep up the great work, cheers",0
We had a fairly straight forward cleaning project- carpeted stairs and vinyl flooring. The crew of 2 jumped right in and got the job done well in a quick 2 hours. Well done!,0
"The floor Specialist (Bobby) did an AMAZING Job on our floors in our apartment when we moved, My wife and I would recommend him to absolutely everyone we know!",0
Why would you choose anybody else?,0
Good work friendly staff,0
"They took the time to listen to our needs, made sure we were getting what we expected and then delivered!",0
"Good food with quick service. One guy run, but cooks very well. Potstickers were a tad dry, but still great.",0
"Never ate here before tonight, last minute decision and I have to say I will def. be eating here again. Ordered Cashew Chicken so good. The Pho delicious and ordered chicken fried rice the chicken was grilled and added to it made it very tasty.",0

Great Mocha Breve's,2
Nice drive thru bbq place. We got there right when opened so didn't have the brisket off the grill yet. The ribs were excellent. So yummy. Pulled pork as well but ribs were better. Husband liked the beans side too. Got a bread roll side for the toddler. Store bought but had been warmed which was a nice touch. Will definitely go again.,0
"10/10. Great food, great prices.",0
Hands down best BBQ in AK!! Can't wait for them to get back up here this seaon... new location we have heard.,0
They had great customer service. The food was mouth-watering delicious. I would highly recommend this business if you and joy BBQ food. The pulled pork sandwiches my favorite.,0
IT IS NO LONGER B B Q PLACE ITS TACO PLACE NOW.,0
The ribs are fantastic and the owners are friendly.,0
"Recently voted the best BBQ in Alaska. Black Jaxx BBQ is the best food and service we've ever had in Soldotna. There is a little wait in line but well worth it. The portions were huge. The rib bones were small and the meat fell off easily. The chicken was the same, moist and tender. The brisket was delicious and the baked beans and potatoe salad is like my southern momma used to make! Will return.",0
Best Brq in Alaska wish they were open year round,0
"A+ quick good portions, you definitely ""can't beat their meat""",0
Amazing bbq year after year!,0
Eat here if you want food poisoning ;/ used to be good not sure what happened!,0

The best rental car company. Which is saying a lot considering all rental car companies customer service standards are so low.,0
Absolutely ðŸ’¯ rude & every time U talk to Em they raise the price of what U owe Em I would highly recommend never going there....I even returned my rental on Christmas Eve ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°,0
Great customer service. Always greet with a smile upon arrival. Have always gone above and beyond to make sure they can provide everything needed for their customer. Last rental I forgot an item in the vehicle and they gladly made all the arrangements for return. Thank you.,0
The Hertz car rental company was a huge help to my wife and I while her car was in the shop. They worked well with our insurance and provided us with a clean and well maintained vehicle to get around in while it was getting repaired. They even scheduled a vehicle to take us to the shop after we had returned the rental. I would highly recommend Hertz to anybody needing a rental car.,0
"They're okay,the car smelled like Marijuana...other than that it was okay.",0
The staff was very friendly and accommodating.,0
good service and nice people there,0
(Translated by Google) I used it when I stayed at Chena Hot Springs and came to see the northern lights. I made a reservation from a travel agency from Japan. There is a parking lot exclusively for rental cars.

"Fast service, provided you're not ordering too much or something that takes extra time to prepare. I was also very impressed with their prices- better than a lot of drive up coffee places I've been to. Also, they make an excellent bagel and brew delicious hot chocolate. I will definitely be stopping by to grab more of both next time I'm in the area!",0
"Always excellent espresso, bagels and they have awesome ice cream cones any time of the day.! Only chocolate or/And vanilla. Very fast, friendly, courteous staff!",0
"Always awesome coming here, and love that they have saurkrout for sandwiches and awesome batista. Ashley was working this evening and is always lovely to see.",0
Love the service and coffee very alaskan friendly would suggest to younger locals with out common dietary constraints or choices. Typically fast service occasionally you get the customer who just doesn't know what they want or the judgmental employee who probably is out of there class anyway but all and all consistent service and grown to have decent expectations of there limited food menu and good to great beverages.,0
Good breakfast burritos and coffee.,0
"I love the service, the atmosphere, and the rich flavor in my dishes.",0
Always good! Easy to get to and great employees. Hot chocolate was niiiice,0
Moderately priced but super yummy. Wish their reward cards could be merged together but that would be the only complaint-which definately doesn't come close to all the good they do for me! Great coffee and yummy food too! Made fresh!!,0
Love the coffee and the atmosphere! The girls are amazing and remember me and my order everytime I stop by. The rewards program is one of the best I have seen. I just redeemed my points for an awesome hydroflask!,0
Fast and friendly. The breakfast burritos are amazing.,0
Soft serve Ice Cream.. on a hot day,0

"Great beers, dog friendly",0
The coffee IPA is different and great!,0
Great information here. Loved everything Alaskan,0
"Wish they hadn't closed this place this summer. They've got fantastic displays, beautiful artwork, but are not opening their doors except for speakers on Friday nights.",0
They often have events that I find interest. Usually educational about the area.,0
"(Translated by Google) Beyond the setting, which is breathtaking, this educational center is extremely enlightening, both for fully understanding what life was like for the first inhabitants of Alaska, and for interpreting its ecosystem. It is very well assembled, it is very didactic and I consider that it is totally recommended to go through it. (Original) MÃ¡s allÃ¡ del entorno, que es sobrecogedor, este centro educativo es sumamente esclarecedor, tanto para comprender cabalmente lo que fue la vida de los primeros habitantes de Alaska, como para interpretar su ecosistema. EstÃ¡ muy bien montado, es muy didÃ¡ctico y considero que es totalmente recomendable pasado por Ã©l.",0
Probably the cheapest place in town but limited hours that you can go in there,0
They have the cheapest rates for storage in the valley.,0
Really nice people,2
Very affordable and they live on property... highly recommended,0
"I like this Storage Unit place because their clean and a respectful business to rent from. I personally like speaking with Linda. '' Thank you Linda "" for working with My Husband and I. ðŸŒˆ God Bless you & Family ! ðŸŒ¸",0
Great secure storage.ðŸ‘,2
"Extremely fair prices and rules, and I loved that they are nice and tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood, all of their units are well maintained, I have used their fenced in units along with their 24 hour units. Their staff is always happy to help and are a very easy bunch to get along with. I like that they live on the lot so you know your stuff is being watched over, not just video taped. Great, I would use them again in a heartbeat!",0
Great to hold your stuff,0
Was really next door for a kids birthday party,0
Great service from helpful staff!,0
Great service safe storage friendly staff,0
"The storage units are old. Doors are small and raised about 1 foot off of the ground, so manoeuvring heavy items can become frustrating. Not climate controlled.",0
Best prices in town,0
Just walked by it.,0
She loved them. What a great store. Wonderful service. I'm so happy.,0
The best (also the only) glass blowing and general glass working place around! If you are planning to go in there for the first time plan ahead and give yourself a couple hours extra because you will want to see all the exceptional and wonderful pieces of glass art that they have to offer!,0
Love this place! They have some of the most beautiful glass pieces that I didnt even know were possible! The kiln flattened bottles made to be mixing spoon rests catch my eye every tome im there,0
Lots of glass trinkets at all price ranges and even a glass crafting materials section. Would love to find the time to take a glass class here.,0
I love glass art and this locally owned shop has beautiful pieces and a great collection of other pretty things. They also make custom designs and offer classes.,0
The owner is very helpful. They stock a wide variety of glass and supplies.,0
Great place to buy gifts!,0
The coffe was good and tasty the lady that worked atthe time very nice.,0
"Had a chance to stop by the other day and Genesis was very friendly and accommodating. They are open during this health crisis and, as long as the directives allow for us to drive-thru and pick up, I hope those passing by will be supportive and stop by to help them stay in business.",0
Love this place. Super friendly staff. They make fantastic coffee. Keep up the fantastic work.,0
Amazing service delicious drinks they even remember my husband and my drinks and make that exactly the way we like every time,0
"Delicious, fast and friendly!!",0
Good drinks and great service,0
Coffee! Reindeer sausage breakfast sammie,0
My favorite coffee spot!,0
Excellent coffee great customer service,0
Like their coffee,2
Excellent street tacos and biria burritos! Hot sauce is just how I get on the street in Cozumel. Most authentic Mexican I've found in town.,0
"Not really impressed.. I picked up a ice cold shrimp taco at 6-28-21 at the 8pm shift... The steak and shrimp burrito was generic, nothing special..Nothing here to really have me running back?",0
"Great food, service and environment. Fantastic views too!",0
Cocktail De Camaron is excellent!,0
Verry good nice,2
They stay open late and work to accommodate both my kids in one visit. My kids love to go have their heads washed there.,0
"We had a wedding hair emergency, and the girls, especially Bobbi (?), stepped up and we're incredible",0
They always do a wonderful job. This is my go to place for haircuts.,0
Nice place to get your hair cut,0
"1 customer, 3 stylists, but no one could cut hair....",0
Mary Anne is awesome!,0
Best for my boys cuts,0
"Excellent on base residential facilities for military personnel and their families. Despite being rolled out of bed by F-16's thundering off the runway, I still found these units to be great places to live. Oh, the pilots gave little sympathy about morning thunder and seemed to enjoy the attention.",0
I like living on base because of the convience of the BX and the commissary. I donâ€™t like how our water gets shut off every other month because repairs are being made. Sometimes the water is brown. I sometimes donâ€™t get data on my phone because of the tower. I hate how we only have 2 options between internet companies. Heater also went out in the garage. The power only shut off once since Iâ€™ve been here so thatâ€™s a plus.,0
Paid $80 to try and get more information and just got ripped off. Went in after 5 minutes realized I couldnâ€™t meet their schedule requirements. Really shouldâ€™ve made that information free.,0
"I've been coming here for the past year or so. I've been pleased with the quality of the service I've received, and no extra charge beyond that of a basic haircut. It is actually a beauty/barber academy and the instructors double check everything prior to the clients leaving. They're also very supportive of military veterans and donate free haircuts for those who can't otherwise afford to pay. I'll continue to come here as long as I live in the Anchorage area.",0
"Wow. I started coming here because they have a partnership with the VA offering free haircuts for Veterans participating in a program. I loved the quality of haircut I received and so kept coming back once I was out of that program and pay for the most thorough haircut I have gotten in the year and a half that I lived here. They even offer hot towel, straight razor shaves! Wow! I keep coming back here and continue to leave very satisfied. Every time.",0
"For $11 bucks, I got a good haircut and shampoo wash. They do a good job.",0
For an affordable hair cut or styling - students get the practical experience necessary to go pro. All work is overseen by experienced teaching staff and management.,0
"Haircut and highlights were ok. Took 4 hours to get it done which was very frustrating. Sitting in a chair for a half hour while someone just touches your hair. Then when I go to pay, I was told that the highlights that I asked for which are advertised as 40 dollars are actually color all over... not highlights. I asked for and got highlights, but paid double the advertised price. I'm not going back",0
Anne was great!,2
Wonderful people and great service,0
"Great prices. The man who was working gave me the best foot/leg massage I've had in a long time. It was great value for the prices, exactly what I needed and a convenient location in walmart. I'll be back",0
Very polite and professional,0
The pedicure was nice. But I had a full set done and I think it could've been a little better. It's a bit bumpy and too much acrylic in some areas. The atmosphere is very comforting. Almost forgot I was in Walmart. ðŸ¤—,0
"I did a pedi and one of the guys the did the service , after he massage my foot it was awesome. I have been to other nail shops and I still have not find anywhere that can do a good massage as I have received at regal nails",0
I got foot fungus there.,0
Excellent customer service and quality work.,0
"I have been a regular, long time customer at the Eagle River shop but today may sadly be my last. Last week I made an appointment for 11 today. Waited over 30 minutes and still no one available for a fill and pedi I requested. Was told, ""She's on her way."" After over 30 minutes, I walked out.",0
A bit short on some flowers that I wanted but Hometown had some so all is good.,0
"I have tried other green houses in town, but never have I had the level of service or the plants look so good. Absolutely the only place i will go.",0
Great price for super healthy plants!,0
The best local greenhouse. They have great plants and also sell quite a few trees and shrubs meant to endure our cold winters. They also do wonderful customer appreciation sales and special events with music and local artists in the summer.,0
Lovely community gathering. Music art and prime plants and everything you could need for cultivating the best of Alaska summer. Fun for all ages.,0
Wow! Amazing. Helpful and I never saw healthier plants for sale. ðŸ˜,0
"Always friendly, helpful and priced right!",0
Great business and helpful employees,0
I just wanted to say the teller went above and beyond to help me get a payment accomplished. He was kind and informative and went the extra mile! You have a gem here! Govanni is a keeper!,0
"The automated call line is a bit challenging to use first time, but the staff are very nice, I always try to be very polite to business employees as I appreciate their help",0
my husband has an account with this bank and we always go through the drive through and staff is very helpful and kind we also leasing our Charger Himi from this bank thank you for everything you guys do for us,0
"Good, small credit union. Better service in my opinion than larger establishments.",0
"Bad staff, no after hour service of any kind. Shut down cards for random reasons making you wait for the next business day to correct leaving you with no money at the worst times. Dont ever use this place",0
"I'm new to True north FCU and all I can say is wow the bank is simply amazing and the staff is the best I've ever had the pleasure to do business with. Chante, Jordan and Anne are a delight and so professional. Chante has be a blessing for my family and many of my friends, she's the best loan officer ever. If your with all the other credit unions believe me it's time to switch to the bank who is truly here to serve Alaskans.",0
Jordan and Chante are very nice and seem well informed with company options and services.,0
"Unless you like being scammed out of your hard earned money, donâ€™t use this bank.",0
Jordon was amazing. Such a great help,0
Great credit union,2
"This is BS! There is a park access with only 5 parking spaces and a ""over flow parking"" apx. quarter mile away... ya-no some people think just because there privileged! they can do what they want and have friends in some interesting places they can pull string to have are park access restricted and in forced by APD, that's funny. It's an incredible hiking trail, but with this restricted parking situation because of some stuck up home owner... I can't give it the five stare ratings it deserves, maybe we can all get together and change things back to the way they should be!",0
A good hike! Somewhat strenuous and great views. Parking lot only text for cars.,0
"Excellent hike with a variety of trails from the trail head. Has access to flat top from the back, peak 2, and peak 3 from the mail trail. All the way back leads to rabbit lake and Mchugh lake. The parking fills quick and overflow parking means that the road can become quite narrow, so be cautions when driving to the trail head. When there are lots of cars, it can be difficult to turn around. Drive a small rig if possible, but the end of the road is still dirt, so keep that in mind.",0
The first mile is a rough go but the view is amazing!,0
"Super windy! Beautiful views, lovely hike.",0
"Wonderful quick access, limited parking",0
Fun to hike in Spring,0
This trail is amazing! Too bad there has been so much animosity from some people in the neighborhood. Looks like there will be more developments to help all enjoy the area.,0
Great hair cut. In and out in and out in 15 minutes. New favorite Barber ðŸ’ˆ,0
"I only get military style haircuts here, but she does a great job. Never to long of a wait, she is quick and proficient.",0
"Friendly, courteous, cleanly, fast, price is fair. An awesome barber right here. Highly recommend this business.",0
Fast haircuts. Not amazing but she gets you in and out in a good time,0
Been going for just about 3 years always get a cut that I like june is very nice!,0
Always a great cutr,0
Quik hair cuts,2
"Only one chair in a small closet like room. Same as a px hair cut, uses the same equipment and leaves long hairs in patches.",0
Great prices for military haircuts,0
Only place I go for haircuts,0
Worst hospital ever! Staff is unprofessional and not trained properly. I've been waiting for a referral for 3 weeks n I keep calling them with no answer or call back. I'm 5 months pregnant and have only seen the doctor twice. If I wasn't been forced to go here I would never step foot in there again. I hate this place with a passion. They only treat uniformed men and women with respect. Ridiculous!,0
"I just had a baby here. I had a very easy pregnancy. So, all the checkups were quick. My delivery was difficult though. I have a stubborn body that needed to be induced. The labor and delivery staff did everything they could think of to progress me into labor. Finally it worked. Sadly, my epidural did not take fully in my uterus. They did their best and helped me manage the pain. We were discharged in a timely manner and with everything we needed.",0
Never had a bad experience however I fully understand that this is a military hospital and I probably won't get the same doctor everytime. Seems like people forget some if not most of the doctors/ staff are military aswell.,0
Sat in the er for over 6 hours in pain waiting to see the doctor for them to tell me it was gonna be another few hours. That was six months ago. ^ Took a friend to the er tonight. Nobody in lobby. She was Throwing up blood multiple times. Waited over an hour. She asked for pain meds while she waited. Waited another hour for no pain meds and nobody checked in her. Rude ass staff when she tried to leave.,0
"Scheduling can be difficult (doctors are limited to 20 minute slots for non-accute issues & 30 minutes for acute). I use Relay Health as much as possible. Because I have multiple issues, for office visits I write everything down in advance just in case several issues are actually connected. So far it has worked for me.",0
Fastest service here than any other army hospital I've been too. I've never had long wait times and everything is very organized.,0
No time for patients. They get 20 minutes for each patients. If you need something done they send you to the ER.,0
This hospital was both a pleasure to work and be treated in.,0
"If you're looking for camping to get away from others, this isn't the place for you. It's a small area and all the spots are right next to each other. This camp area is more for groups to get together and be loud. However, it's a great camping area if you're just looking to chill somewhere with a view, see wildlife, hang with friends, and have the option of getting beers and food from the bar. I tent-camped for the weekend. I will give this a 5 star because the staff was nice, the food and beer were still being served (even with COVID precaution by using masks and takeout only which was fine), and it's walking distance to everything in Hope. The facilities were stocked. I wished RVs and tents were separated out a little more. I had an RV running its generator 5 feet from my tent for hours, but there's not much I can do about it. Regardless, I'd go back again.",0
Went here to see the town of hope. Excellent town and campground people seem to think it's ok to leave there dogs off a leash here though.,0
"Here's the thing, I'm marking this as a 4-star because it did the job and I kind of had an idea of what it'd be like from other reviewers. I had hope there'd be a little bit more space between RVs but it is what it is and given the fact that it is the 4th of July weekend and it was a last-minute decision to go to Hope, I'm grateful that there was a spot at all for me to park! So Let's moderate expectations of this RV park. If you are thinking trees and a little privacy between RV spots, you'll be sorely disappointed. It's a parking lot. Do not expect put out your awning and sit under it or have a firepit space. You will basically have either a spot behind you near the creek but only if you're lucky enough to get there before your neighbors get there and spread out. Other than that, the slots are marked with logs and are just wide enough to accommodate the width of an RV and maybe a slide. Just know that your window will be very close to your neighbor... However the views when you walk away from the RV park are gorgeous. The creek nearby is fun to play in...if you get to your spot before your neighbors take over. $25/night for a spot with electricity was reasonable but if you're a light sleeper, you'll dislike being so close to other RV and tent campers. Staff is friendly and if you call and no one answers, just keep calling because the lady who runs the office will sometimes be out putting the reserved signs up. I also had success emailing and they called me back letting me know availability which I thought was very nice. So I hope this informs you. For me this would be a one-night stay but it worked for the night I'm here! Pic: view towards the ocean just a 5 min walk from RV parking lot.",0
"Off the beaten path tent and rv, rv has electric. Right on the creek",0
"Once the fish hit, they canâ€™t stop",0
"The location is great! But the spots are very tight and zero privacy! This is more of a place for groups, it was very loud very late at night. They do have quiet hours that I thought they enforced but didnt. We personally wont be back.",0
"Beautiful location. Only parked for the day, it was nice to be able to get so close to the shore.",0
Great place to stay We came when the horseflies are bad but thats not on them Wish there was a park at the campground for the kids though,0
Rating a place only makes sense when there are other choices. This is the experience in Hope.,0
Don't use the bathrooms even if you eat at the restaurant on site! Also stay away if you are native or they will chase you out! Do not support this POS business!,0
This is the only place that I have ever had the manicurist actually get in and remove my ingrown toenail. Most places are too soft and don't really do anything to help your feet I have never had such a good feeling rub and just general great care of my feet at any other place.,0
"Made my wife's nails awesome, again. Grat service and very friendly.",0
"Unfortunately I hadn't read the reviews before I went in. My friend and I both received manicures. Hers was fabulous (done by a younger woman tech) but mine was horrible because I did have the older lady tech do my French Tips. Cuticles were not done correctly, white polish for the French Tip was smeared and not painted evenly. Wish I could present a picture, but don't see any way to attach. Since they have other complaints about this same older tech, why continue to use her?",0
"I had so much fun! The nail techs were friendly, conversational, and pretty darn hilarious. Excellent atmosphere.",0
I love this family. Quality work with fair prices. All 10 of my toenails were ingrown when I came in for a pedicure and Ms. Tu took care of me like it was nothing. I felt so much better when I left other than the general soreness associated with ingrown toenails. I won't go anywhere else.,0
My oldest wanted her cartilage pierced and I didn't want her getting taken somewhere that wasn't experienced with piercing. She is VERY happy with her newest holes.,0
Got my nose piercing so happy it's healing properly!,0
"Honestly, I'm sure this guy is great on the regular, but on a wednesday night at 6pm, after making an apointment the day before he acted like I wasnt a priority and actually messed my tattoo up because he left halfway through it to pierce people's noses. Very unprofessional. Not only that but I had to talk him down because it was over charged. Literally will never recommend anyone to this establishment if I can help. I would be too embarrassed.",0
"He was very friendly knowledgeable got my ear done correctly this time and my kiddo's nose. Very clean we walked in with out an appointment and in 10 minutes we where done, only thing is they only take cash so Bring it Son lol. I'll be going here again for sure.",0
Love Rocky and his work!,0
"I got 3 piercings here a lip,nose,and chest dermal. The guy was very nice and sanitary. A week after I got them done i couldn't untwist my lip ring to change it out. I walked in and he did it for me right away. The very next day I pulled out my dermal on accident half way out. Again without notice I showed up and he fixed it at no cost. Thank you so much very friendly and understanding.",0
"Got us right in and out, very pleasant, explained the care and what would happen if my son didn't take proper care of his piercing. Was very careful to be sterile.",0
"Rocky did a great job on footprints, and was really fast too.",0
Rocky is a fantastic artist. I can't wait to do another one.,0
"Very nice gentlemen, full of information and was wonderful at helping my daughter be at ease with the process of getting her first body piercing.",0
Very friendly and fast. Tip eat a lot before getting something done.,0
Rocky is the best at piercings!,0
Awesome ass work so happy with my tat,0
Always prompt courteous,2
Very nice helpful employees always ready to assist you and seem to really care about you and your health needs. Much better than the service gotten at a chain pharmacy.,0
You can really tell that that staff at Geneva Woods pharmacy really cares about their patients. From the minute you walk in the door they treat you like their number one priority patient and make sure that you get the equipment or medication that you need and provide you with all the information you need to make sure that you are set to go before you on your way. I have no problem at all recommending them to anyone that is in need of their products.,0
Love this pharmacy and the help they provide for newborns with specialty milk! They are always in stock.,0
best pharmacy i've ever used. they also deliver and will bill monthly if you qualify.,0
Thank you for all your great services and assistance,0
Good place to het health supplies and understanding staff ðŸ˜‰,0
"They fill medsets and have a great pharmacy, also have walkers, wheelchairs, canes, assistive devices.",0
Great pharmaceutical business seem to have every range of products.,0
"The staff is wonderful, they help very well",0
"Though they have everything delivery, bubble packaging, the works, sometimes the inside doesn't know what's happening. The staff are nice though",0
Services were super great and friendly environment,0
Clean handicap parking handicap doors open for wheelchair access,0
Love Geneva Woods and there coffee and great service.,0
Professional place well equipped.,0
If your needing. They can help,0
Got what I need at an sffordable price!,0
Great medical supplies,2
Depends on the day,0
Pretty good Starbucks location. They make my drink the same every time which is nice! Good customer service as well.,0
The baristas are always super friendly and quiet cheerful....I suspect they do shots of espresso all through their shift cause if I worked at Starbucks I definitely would lol....and the coffee always taste great and Iâ€™ve never had to wait to long even when theyâ€™re slammed with other patrons.,0
Coffee is coffee it ok or good I'm like te,0
This particular Starbucks wasn't very good at the time the staffing for very unfriendly and the coffee wasn't as good as normal,0
"I love, love, love how they are open literally everyday of the year! Better prices than other store. Best place to buy soda pop or munchies",0
"Easily my favorite grocery store in Barrow. Prices are about the same as AC, major difference is they have a unique variety of items, as well as one of the friendliest staff I've ever encountered.",0
"ALWAYS open, they're starting to carry a few really good items, can be covered in dust but over all they are always there for you! ;) Even during some hard times.",0
Better prices usually then AC on what they have. Friendly staff.,0
I like shoppi g for pop and cheesecake.,0
I got noodle and soda at here.,0
"I have been going to this pool since the early 90s. One of my favorite pools in Anchorage , out of all the high schools. They have an awesome kids pool , if you are taking your toddlers!!",0
Hello... How Are You.... I AM Under The Water... Please Help Me....,0
I do lap swim at the Dimond pool on the weekends and I always have my own lane.,0
Great place to bring the kids tho burn off some energy. They offer swim classes for kids which are affordable and fun.,0
"It's clean here, water pretty warm, no hot tub tho.",0
Excellent facility for children's swim lessons!,0
"The staff is great, but the facilities REALLY need to be renovated",0
We always a good time.,0
It's not the same but that was 20 years ago.,0
Good swim place for the price,0
"Clean bathrooms, 2 of them. 2 showers. Nice location.",0
"Awesome owners, and a safe environment for families with kids. One of the cleanest facilities I've seen, that includes down south too!",0
I spent 60 and all my laundry was wet,0
Brightly lit and clean. A little far for Douglas but it's better than the one downtown. Prices are super high though... came here because our washer broke and it cost us over $20 to do a weeks worth of laundry.,0
"Nice and clean, so was always comfortable going in and using the laundry mat showers. Price is rightðŸ˜Š",0
"Clean showers! A bit expensive on the laundry side, but that's Juneau for ya. This is the place to go for a hot shower and clean laundry.",0
Decent place. Great location....right next to the bar!,0
"Crowded. The owner is an abrupt man with a scary German shepherd, but he was courteous and it was clean there.",0
"Super clean, new machines.",0
Very clean and prices are fair,0
Newer appliances and keep clean.,0
They always have most of what I need!,0
Had parts and friendly service today,0
Friendly staff and were having an end of year sale,0
Basic NAPA. Can order parts.,0
Great customer service,2
Everyone was so helpful here.,0
Hard to get right parts first time.,0
Great Auto Parts store and great staff,0
Today was my first time eating here and I highly recommend it. Try the gyro.,0
Lots of great food. Their wings are exception. No wonder they got second place in town at a wing contest a few years agi,0
I love the catfish. I've been a fan for this restaurant for years,0
"Duane and Carmen make the experience better, Roscoe and the portion sizes subtracts from the overall experience.",0
Small place that has both Gyros and BBQ... So I didn't anticipate it being this good. The food was great! Service was excellent. Gumbo was expensive but worth it! Best I ever had. My friend had ribs and they were spectacular.,0
"AKA: Roscoe's has the best Philly cheese steak sandwich! I cannot even describe how perfectly the bread was toasted, it had the perfect toasted crunch! The homemade fries were amazing! My wife had a plate from the sides menu, homemade macaroni & cheese, collard greens, fried okra, cornbread and butter, with a sweet tea. Our son had a lamb and beef gyro with a superb thick tsziki sauce with onion rings! My wife is going back for a gyro tomorrow.",0
We were greeted as we entered the building by the owner himself and a waitress. The Food was excellent! Not too long of a wait. The only downside was the parking on the street. Could use a remodel and maybe some new tables and chairs.,0
"Inside a larger soul food restaurant, this hole in the wall has friendly staff, a great owner, and really solid food. Just coming in the smell was fantastic. Service was a bit slow, but the quality of the gyro makes me want to come back soon.",0
"It's a dive, but in a good way. Not dirty, just a hole in the wall kind of place with good food, made to order. I've never had a bad meal there.",0
Very tasty meals at a modest price.,0
Friends and excellent food for the soul!,0
I think my digestive system is unqualified for this establishment. Had the gumbo. Poor server was a bit challenged to meet the needs of the guests. Went at 6:15p on a Monday,0
Waited 20 before leaving.,0
Best sandwiches and pork in Anchorage,0
Waited too.... Sucked,2
First dispensary in Alaska before we voted 420 into the law,0
"After reading these reviews, I guess I will never see what the fuss is about. Its a shame that these guys have this great opportunity but step on it with no respect for the customer (which is the whole reason for their existence). What a pity.......",0
Love this place but it's closed now,0
Best 420 ever. ðŸ˜ðŸ˜Ž,0

"Stopped in at 1250 am September 6th. Made a beeline for the bathrooms which were both locked. Was informed by kristy that the bathrooms had been locked for cleaning. Being so late, or early, nowhere else was open, and my partner and I needed to use the toilet. It was not until 140a that the bathrooms were open. 40 minutes to clean two bathrooms at the same time is ridiculous. The lady on the register seemed preoccupied and did not ask if I wanted a receipt. She said thank you, and turned away. I had to request a receipt twice. The bathrooms were well cleaned.",0
Air pump does not work,0
They always have good coffee,0
"I was overcharged for my gas. I went inside and pre-authorized my Visa card. Three days later, my card was charged $53.78, yet the purchase was only $42.50. The phone number listed for this business is out of service.",0
This outsider shop is cool,0
Awesome customer service,2
Holding it down!,2
"I was told to leave the store. I asked why and I was told it was because I had surgical gloves on. She said I could be speading stuff from all over town on their items, (as if bare hands won't). I explained that I put on a new pair every time I go into a new store. She said it didn't matter. I feel that asking me to remove the gloves would have been more appropriate. I was going to spend a bit of money too... I needed some cookware.",0
"Great staff, wonderful store, and a great set of products! My wife and I enjoy the ""Zeal"" brand quite a bit.",0
Awesome store pricey but isn't that the cost you pay for quality. Great staff always helpful and kind. Quiet clean store and great products,0

"Oh now this is a FUN place to hang! Filled with smart-alecky Alaskans, silly jokes, wild exaggerations, loudly shuffling dominos and fast-paced Bingo, this is a perfect place to meet and make lifelong friends. And the lunchtime grub is 100% first class, cooked right there and seasoned wonderfully. LOVED IT!",0

The cashier was nice but frozen yogurt were terrible. Watery sugar. I am glad to know not to go back.,0
Owner is super friendly. His staff needs some help in customer. They were more focused on hanging with friends that helping those who came in. The products were delicious. I had the Gelato and it was heavenly. My husband had the dole whip and it was fresh creamy and tart. The kids wanted vanilla froyo but they were out and the kid at the counter had no interest in making any. They ended up with vanilla Gelato and loved it. Over all great place.,0

"If you are picky about your lattes (like me), go here. This is the best coffee stand/shop I have found in Anchorage. Great friendly service and most of all, they make darn good lattes & mochas. They make sure to steam milk to the best frothiness and do not let the espresso shots expire.",0
"My go-to coffee hut on the way to work. Occasionally a couple of the baristas over fill the cup so that even with the lid on there's a little bit of spillage on Anchorage's wonderful roads, but that's my only real complaint and it's really not nearly as bad as if they under filled the cup.",0
We use them at our business - great place for shirts and other apparel for logo'd business wear. Prices are good and turn over is fairly quick. Great local business!,0
"These guys were friendly and quick to answer questions. They helped me with ideas. My favorite thing about visiting the store in person was the exceptionally large amount of sample work. I know exactly what we ordered, exactly what to expect, and I am already assured of the quality I will be receiving.",0
The very best print shop in Anchorage,0

Just Lawns performed the fall lawn service. I just got completely overwhelmed with all the leaves. I called them up and they were able to get out and take care of my lawn within two days.

"Channel 2 Viewers Choice Awarded, Best Lawn Service/Landscaper.",0
"I am so happy with the work Just Lawns does. I have a yard that grows wild daisies in place of grass, after letting them grow all year they got a bit out of control. Come spring my lawn was filled with 3 feet high dead daisy stalks!

"Always have a great experience with AAT. I fly with them often for work. Flights are usually on time or early, the staff is always helpful an willing to answer any questions one might have. The parking is convenient too, especially if I'm out of town for more than the day. Safety and comfort always seems to be at the forefront for them, which is great for travelers not used to smaller aircraft.",0
"Alaska Air Transit have excellent employees. I arrived early for my flight, so there were hardly any customers in the building. It felt great to take my time and the employees weren't rushing, so they had plenty of time to help me with my questions and luggage. My truck was parked in overnight parking, so no worries about parking. The pilot was very funny and also very polite. The flight was very quick, so don't get too comfortable. The seating is great for standard size folks, so if you're taller or wider then you may have some space issues. All my luggage arrive in one piece, so I can't complain about anything! I highly suggest flying with Alaska Air Transit. If this review was helpful please click the Like button.",0
Great and fast service. Very professional crew! Highly recommend to anyone needing to get there now!,0

Love the place. Food is nice and service is quick,0
"I got the crab cake burger. It was very delicious. It is expensive, but crab is crab. The only downside is that at first, the waitress seemed a little impatient. I ordered it to go with a soda. When the cook brought it out, it was like a dine-in plate. They also forgot the soda. It's a little unprofessional, and I would like to see more communication and more patience.",0
"Crab is the only reason patronize this establishment. The king crab legs are delectable. Other items? the fries are greasy and limp, the breading on the halibut is wimpy, tasteless, and slides off the fish, finally, the fish itself is standard issue frozen halibut.",0
Excellent food! Price was WAY CRAZY! otherwise it would be 5 stars it's that good.,0
Good fish and chips. Fresh fish and fresh cut fries.,0
Great crab and really great chowder! One of the first restaurants we ate at when we got to Seward and the service was good. The guy at the counter told us alot about Seward.,0

Ice cream and friendly service. No brainer.,0
Largest assortment of candy in Skagway. So stop here if you need some bride candy for your kids to behave. Smaller store so it gets a little crazy when they get busy. Their fudge is more expensive than the Alaskan Fudge Company down the street.,0

"I have been to many chiropractors over the years in a few different states. This is the best chiropractic office I've ever been in. I love how streamlined everything is. I usually have no trouble getting in without an appointment, which can be difficult for me to make since I live out in the valley and run a couple of businesses. Oh, and did I mention I drive all the way from the Wasilla to go here! I've tried other chiropractors, but they all want exorbitant fees to get you started in their office. Dr. Lloyd made it easy to get started and easy to get in every time. He does an amazing job and it's clear he really loves what he does and cares about his clients - that's what keeps me coming back.",0
"I can truly say the staff and doctors here are 100% amazing, every time Iâ€™ve interacted with them I have been helped even more than I had hoped for- and itâ€™s always with a level of friendliness and understanding that is in possible to compete with. They make you feel welcome as if youâ€™re family, and the staff is flexible with scheduling as well.

I look forward to my visits every week. Thank you Amber and Stephanie for your miraculous massage efforts! I don't want to know where I would be without you all!",0
Staff is very caring. Doctor Wise and PT Doc know what they are doing. I am getting well quickly from a 20 year chronic back and neck problem.,0
Great place! Great staff!,0
Awesome staff that are very accommodating and they listen! Dr. Lloyd is very gentle and his techniques are unique from any other chiropractors I've seen in 30 years. I'm very impressed with how he does business. One morning I was in right after they opened and observed a team cheer by the staff - Dr. Lloyd must be an amazing guy to work for!,0
"Super flexible with scheduling. Multiple doctors, masseuses, and a physical therapist on staff. A good crew.",0
"Fast, friendly, and a very clean an updated office. Will definitely recommend!",0

Maria us the best. Fixed my daughter's hair after many bad cuts elsewhere,0
Christie does amazing work!,0
I had a great experience twice. Didn't realize you had to call ahead but no worries. Greasy but buttery. It's a quick cheap pizza and the staff at the counter are nice. I ordered a mushroom topping and it tasted fresh. Also a nice woman ran out to my car in Anchorage's freezing rain/hale to bring me my pizza. Those are employees who care. If you want a cheap good pizza go here. Otherwise upgrade to Uncle Joe's. Depends on your budget I guess.,0
"Ordered a ham and pineapple pizza, When I got home, the pizza had been poorly made. I took it back to have it replaced and they did that without issue, and provided a $10 credit. Satisfied with the responce.",0
A little slow tonight but still good pizza,0

Way over priced,2
"Great guy, great experience. We rented an ATV this weekend and it went just as we hoped. Stopped by picked up the ATV with helmets and ramp. We were advised some good trails to check out. We rode the ATV though some deep mud and ruts. Then gave it a light rinsing and dropped it off with no problems. The ATV was a newer 2015 Honda and did great. Hope all of the rentals go this smoothly for customer and owner.",0
The guys scammed me put of a 1000 bucks for fake damages,0

"Got the ceramic coating done by them for my car and it looks amazing, definitely gives the paint that extra ""pop"" now!",0
"Detailed Review: I want to give a detailed review so I will outline my exact process I contacted Cardeets through the online portal, I received several text messages and a phone call outlining exactly what was wanted to be done to my vehicle. This included a detail inside and out, debadge, tailgate film and ceramic pro. It was all scheduled, then I though of some questions and they responded very well through text messages. Prior to the service I warned of how dirty my vehicle was inside and out, mostly dust and moderate dog hair. Day of the service: I dropped the vehicle off, there was some confusion when I arrived, I guess it wasn't fully communicated from the person that I talked to and the person receiving the vehicle, but they took it in stride. Day 2 I got a call letting me know that since the vehicle was not brand new there was areas of staining on the OEM PPG film. I said that would be ok and I stopped by to take a look. Total I dropped it off on a Wed and vehicle was done on a Sat Morning after I got a phone call I came to pick it up. Interior: they did a pretty good job cleaning the dirt but quite a few missed spots in common easily missed areas, like the front of the gear selector and door handles/sills. I didn't see any evidence of steam cleaning the upholstery which would have made more of the dust clean off the seat Exterior: Definitely clean and no swirl marks or scratches, though there were not many prior to bringing it in, the 1 area I pointed out of a chip was half filled in, I spotted two other areas that I didnt spot before but were not filled in or fixed. Areas around the door edge protector and edges had a dust/left over chemical, but didnt bother me too much I made sure to follow the 14 day hardening curing process, basically almost no water or rain, garaged and didn't clean or get any chemicals or bird poop on it. Stopped back at car deets for 1st car wash after curing process that it took about 1 hour or less. Now I have yearly follow up appts Light cleaning weekly with water and minimal soap So far looks to be beading up well and cleaning off easy, TLDR Summary: 1. The interior detail was a little lacking, several common areas that were completely missed or not cleaned at a high standard. This is ok, the car was quite messy prior even for a newer vehicle. 2. For the price would expect the complete exterior to be cleaned, but little areas like the door sills and under the door frame are completely neglected. 3. The paint correction done on this 1 year old vehicle was not bad but several areas definitely missed and not mentioned by the detailer. 3. The Ceramic Pro seems to be holding up ok and the vehicle is definitely easier to clean, Ill be interested to see how it lasts for several years as per the warranty claim. 4. They didnt try and sell my any snake oil and just recommended Johnson baby shampoo,",0
"Awesome service. They have always been very reliable and quick, as well as diligent in giving you an estimated time on when they will be done and then calling you once the job is finished. Plus our dirty as heck truck always comes out looking new.",0
This is the second time Iâ€™ve had Car deets clean my vehicle. I figured I would give him a second chance with a bad experience I hit the first time where I had to take my Vehicle back to be done again. This time was even worse. Dirty shoe marks from the employee inside the vehicle there were compartments that werenâ€™t even cleaned and honestly did not look like they even clean the carpet. There were run marks down the side of the vehicle as well. Iâ€™m afraid I will not be going back I am OK with a second chance but not a 3rd,0
Great experience! Had my Subaru detailed before we listed it for sale. They did a great job and we sold it the same night we listed it.,0
"We were extremely impressed by Jim and his crew. Professional, fair and courteous.",0
"Went out with these guys an a nice halibut and rockfish charter. Captain was Jake and megan was the mate. Both were friendly and accommodating and Jake did a great job of explaining all the ins and out of the trip. The trip was productive and awesome. There were five of us on the boat, we hit a few halibut, them limited out on. Lack rockfish in just a few minutes, and then finished limiting out on halibut. We even stopped on the way back in to check out some mountain goats and stellar sea lions. I only have one small issue from the trip. Megan seemed new to being a Mayer, and jake showed her how to filet the halibut, which he did all of, and then let her filet the rockfish. Unfortunately, like I said, she seemed new and didnt know to quite filet these fish, and she let a lot of meat on them and gave us a bunch of small or raggedy filets. But the trip was still awesome, my suggestion for this make sure that the mates know how to best and effectively the filet the catch so we can maximize our yield and not create any waste. But this isn't a deterrent by any means, I'd head out with these guys again anytime, and probably will.",0
Used them twice this year. Landed some nice halibut and rockfish.,0
"We had such a great time, well all except my husband who quickly realized that he developed sea sickness since he'd last been on a boat! Great guides and our freezer is stocked with halibut, salmon and rock fish!! The trip took a out 8 hours total, two hours riding to the spot, 4 there, and 2 riding back to the dock. Our guides gutted and cleaned everything for us and put it into large trash bags. We did the rest. I highly recommend this charter! Almost forgot to mention the wonderful ladies in the office that provided us with their own personal fishing gear when they saw how unprepared we were for a cold windy trip! They gave us hot coffee and bundled us up! They were angels! We wouldn't have survived the way we were dressed for sure! This company is an A+ in my book!",0
"We took this charter for a halibut and rockfish trip. They knew great spots for us to go to and everyone limited out. They had alot of good information and were very attentive to instructing us when to watch our poles. This charter was the best we have had yet in Alaska. Staff was great except 1 issue. I caught a halibut early on and was told it was a 28.9 inch, they said great getting a big little one. So I kept fishing for a big one. Later brought up a 60 lb halibut, biggest one I've ever caught. Well after I got it up they decided to confirm my other halibut size and said it was over 32 inch and that they would have to release it. I wanted to cry. Had they told me that in the first place I would have given the pole to my husband or daughter who hadn't caught anything yet before I reeled bc I knew he was big when he struck. I know they have a job to do and there are guidelines but had they measured at first instead of guessing my family would have a freezer full instead of all chicken halibut. I will reccomend this charter, but always with a warning bc I was discouraged the rest of the trip, didnt even feel comfortable fishing after that.",0
"We went in a group and there were a lot of people in the boat. Ours was a multi-species trip: Halibut, Rockfish, and Silvers.They're nice folks and did a good job on rod management. Their halibut location was killer. We got eighteen or twenty in an hour. A bit protective about the GPS though, don't take one into the boat.",0
"In my 45 years of fishing in Alaska and being a very discriminate angler, Puffin Fishing Charters exemplifies customer care and equally important, care for the resource. They will always do right by their customers and for the future of the fisheries. You can't go wrong and you won't find anyone more accommodating.",0
"Great crew and great trip. Crew was friendly and professional. The boat was well equipped and we'll maintained. Most importantly, they got the entire boat of 18 people their limit of fish. Would definitely recommend.",0
"Knowledgeable charters with great personalities. Show up early, ask if you want pictures with your fish, and everything will go great.",0
had a great time,0
Bucket list folks,2
"Delicious high end chocolate. Their drinking chocolate is really good. can't wait to try their coffee chocolate dry rub while cooking steak. They are rather expensive when it comes to their truffles, a bit more than I wanted to spend. The place is cute and has a nice atmosphere.",0
Absolutely lovely. They have so many things to try and look at.,0
I love mixing up coffee dates with hot chocolate dates at Modern Dwellers. The Mayan spicy is my favorite! And the truffles are so delicious and beautiful. Also a great place for gifts! Everyone loves chocolate.,0
"A trendy chocolaterie in the heart of midtown. This hip chocolate infused cafe boasts handmade truffles, spicy Mayan drinking chocolate, and a bevy of exotic drinks. There are large and small bars of varietal chocolate that are on display for the wandering spirit or savvy shopper in search of chocolate delights.",0
"The atmosphere is delightful. Beautiful chocolates and even some sugar free choices. Fun coffee experience, you get to choose the chocolate for your mocha. Spendy but worth it.",0
Amazing chocolatiers. This shop has charm and character. Great chocolate and people. Always delicious and rich,0
Total hidden gem! The spicy drinking chocolate is one of the best things I've ever had. Great spot with fun decor:),0
"So wonderful to have such a beautifully crafted business in Anchorage. Weather you want a special sweet treat or gift for a special person, this is a great place to stop by.",0
"What an exceptional place, best drinking chocolate we've had. Relaxing atmosphere, Tricky to find but we'll worth it.",0
First time here. Great experience and great service. We had a fun time trying the different truffles although they are very expensive.,0
I have to retract my good review. The chocolate is really good but some of the employees are detestable snobs. I'll never shop there again due to the treatment I've received. Anyways $8 is too expensive for a bloody mocha. I can make my own drinking chocolate anyways.,0
"Smells delicious, cozy. Lots of beautiful treats",0
"Tasty chocolate beverages in a warm atmosphere lead to a good time. Not to be missed if your visiting, and located with some great other shops.",0
These guys are great! Awesome drinking chocolate!,0
"Love Modern Dwellers, great service and great coffee. Would come here everday if I could.",0
Omg!! What's to say? ... CHOCOLATE!! This place is AWESOME!!,0
I love the drinking chocolate best.,0
Jac Q #deadorinjail,2
Great chocolate coffee,2
Perfect for souvenirs!,2
Friendly environment. I came in late but was accounted for. Theyâ€™re perfect at their job and get retainers polished well for fit.,0
Professional. The location is great for anyone living in the valley. Their office is clean and very modern. The entire staff is knowledgable and friendly.,0
I love how detailed the assistant was and their payment plan option. The phots were so clear and awesome. They truly care about patients.,0
"Tia and Dr. Luff were great about calming my very anxious 7 year old and examined her very thoroughly. They discussed all of our options and didn't rush through the examination. After everything, they decided to wait 6 months to make sure the treatment plan was followed through properly and would be more beneficial to her. We can't wait to go back and get the ball rolling. Thank you!",0
"Polite and efficient staff! Willing to work around schedules and issues! They remember you, you're more than a number to them!",0
"The other reviews say it all. Friendly staff, free consultations, great prices and effective results. The only negative reviews on here are actually towards the previous owner, so this place has almost a perfect 5 star score. They're definitely doing everything right!",0
"Great experience, amazing staff, wonderful results. Very pleased with the outcome and would recommend to anyone looking for orthodontic care.",0
Dr. Luff is a pleasure to work with. He is very informative and offers an array of treatment options.,0
They are so nice and helpful,0
For the last 2 1/2 years my daughter has been seen by ptarmigan and I haven had a bad experience. Theyâ€™ve always answered my calls or called back within hours. And normally have not had to wait weeks for an appointment . We loved Randy Twenhafel. He truly cares for the kids and makes a scary time for them seem like itâ€™s not so bad at all kind of attitude. Iâ€™d recommend ptarmigan any day.,0
It had knowledgeable and decent people there. Like the doctors a lot,0
"Unprofessional makes me 2nd guess diagnosis. Waited 1hr as emergency walk in, they said 15min wait. I asked why, she said, ""Oh, the person ahead of you came in late so we took them first."" Didn't even let me know. We left. /Emailed for apt. 1 week later called & asked why I don't have one. They said I didn't leave my email (it's required in their system in order to send an email through the website) later came in and Dr. said she thinks it's this or that, gave me instructions on a paper towel & said, if it doesn't work... we'll figure out what to do next? (It isn't working, that's why I decided to write this) I need to find a new Dr.",0
"From the front desk people to the nurses to the doctors. I have received the best care for my kids. My anxiety can get the best of me at times, and they are so good to check my kids out to make sure it is just a cold or something small. No matter how busy they are they always seem to get me into see someone. They are excellent all around.",0
"We have twins that have been with Ptarmigan Pediatrics from birth to 6 years old - so far. I believe we have had care from every doctor and assistant at the office. We have received 5 STAR care whether it be from an emergency call both day or night to regular check ups - from the front desk coming in to the front desk checking out. In addition, We are taken into a room and the care begins within an acceptable wait time.",0
"Dr. Hess is absolutely amazing. He is kind, compassionate, patient, and always answers all our questions thoroughly and thoughtfully. He really goes above and beyond; taking our newborn's' blood sample to the lab at the hospital himself, encouraging us to call him after hours if we need to, and taking his day off to do in-patient surgery. Seriously! Dr. Hess also really makes us feel at ease and less anxious, we had a couple quite stressful hospitalizations for our baby and he was our rock. We couldn't think more highly of him! I work in radiology and have witnessed all kinds of patient care, both good and bad. Thank you, Dr. Hess, for being such a wonderful provider.",0
We love Dr. Hess!,0
Everyone at AKMLD is so compassionate with each furry family member. Excellent caring staff.,0
They keep a nice watch on the dogs and have an excellent facility. Staff is friendly and responsible. Our dog loves her day-care days,0
I have been taking my dog Racey here for about 6 years. Marlene and her staff love the dogs dearly. They keep your dog safe and happy. They do not tolerate dogs that are not trained. This is for the safety of other dogs as well as the safety of the employees. I have always felt my dog is safe and well cared for at AK Must Love Dogs.,0
Great kennel and daycare. They know our dog by name and are excited to see her. Doesn't come home stressed.,0
They're great with dogs and dogs have a good time playing!,0
Great place to board your fur babies!.the staff provides excellent care and attention!,0
The staff here is amazing and the dogs love everything about the place,0

This place truly is all about the dogs.,0
Wonderful experience. It's such a stress relief for Cary to professionally get our taxes ready for sending off.,0
Always helpful and I always get what I need,0
I am still waiting for my 2019 tax return that I filed in person at H&R Block in Wasilla Alaska in February of 2020.,0
Got three years caught up.,0
You guys are great,0
I have peace of mind that my taxes are done right. Never have to worry that I will get audited by the IRS. Friendly and knowledgeable staff.,0
Was quick and easy and the employee was very helpful and kind.,0
"Go somewhere else. I got a call from H&R Block back in January to come in and file for 2017 - which I was told would be a free service. I have done my taxes with H&R Block for the last 3 years so I thought, ""well that's nice of them"". I scheduled back in January and met with a local agent that same month who got all my information from my business entered into the computer - which took about an hour. She recommended I go home and try to find a few more receipts (which were really inconsequential deductions anyway), and she said she would save my info so we could pick up where we left off. Jump ahead to today when I went back in (to what I thought would just be a final sign-off on the paperwork), NONE of my info was saved from the previous meeting, so all that time was wasted. Then, to top it off, I was charged $350 for the service - which was no more complicated than the EZ form from previous years. I was not told that the price increases so dramatically for a small business filing until it was all done. Seriously, it wasn't brought to my attention AT ALL. I can't even tell you how sick and disappointed I am at the deceitful tactic used by this company to get people in with fake incentives and then take advantage of them. I will not come back to H&R Block. Ever. And I will tell everyone I know what they did. If you're going to charge a drastically higher rate, at least have the decency to give someone some warning. And I honestly don't feel that the service I received today was worth more than the $80 I usually pay for my filing. There was no more work involved on the accountant's end than with the EZ form. Absolutely ridiculous and disappointing. You lost a customer.",0
always helpful and knowledgeable about new tax laws.,0
Go elsewhere they did my taxes said I got money then got the money only to be told by the IRS I have to pay that money back plus interest and got messed over. Stay away,0
They take care of you,0
Amazing friendly service that was fast,0
I swear every time I get gas or purchase a quick snack at this place I get a smile and the best service ever from people checking me out. They are so kind and helpful even if itâ€™s just a gas station the customer service is outstanding. Itâ€™s clean they have quick pay at the pumps liquor store food everything you need on a road trip or if you forgot something on the way to have a good weekend. Not to mention if youâ€™re out of propane or ice A+ in my book I always go to this place before anywhere else,0
Love this place and the people! Always are friendly and make you feel welcome! The ladies there sure are amazing I enjoy seeing them and visiting!,0
Still has small town feel which is important to the locals who've been here through it all.,0
"What a wonderful small town grocery story, hoe favorite for weekend trips.",0
"Awesome pizza, GREAT people, best price on gas in town!",0
"After waiting in a long line for 25 minutes patiently, the sandwich maker decided he needed to make the sandwiches for to go orders, never mind that I was one of two people left waiting in the lobby. When I brought this to his attention he informed me that he had 5 tickets he needed to fill. I told him that the people in front of him took priority, I missed my lunch , and now I'm hungry and annoyed!",0
"I've ordered the same thing online a few times now and only had a good experience once. This time I went in to make sure I got what I asked for (always the same, steak and cheese melt) and there was barely any meat and the brown paper bags they put it in always makes the cheese and half the ""innerds"" get stuck on it and not in the bread at all. Most of the staff were really unclean looking and weren't wearing any hair coverings, etc... so I was pretty grossed out as soon as I walked in. Unfortunately, after trying it 4 or 5 times now, I wont be going back.",0
"Love the staff from this Subway! They are always friendly and service is fast, but not rushed :) Best one in town!",0
Usually a good experience. Never had too many issues here and the food is good.,0
They never mess up my order even on their horrible phone app. The staff here are pretty chill as well.,0
Always nice to stop and grab some good sandwiches. Friendly staff!,0
It was Awesome as always that's one of the best Subways in town they make the sandwiches perfect everytime and the people there are always polite and the place is always super Clean.,0
"Being one of the only places open near my work I have been going most week days, and its almost always the same guys, both super chill and helpful, probably my favorite subway so far.",0
Always fast and delicious!,0
Great and polite service.,0
Subway my Go_to for healthy n Quick Sandwiches place,0
"This is definitely my go-to healthy fast food option. Love the food, the price, and I've been lucky with good service every time!",0
"There is 1 person at this location in the 4 years I've been coming that seems to care about my sandwich. If he is not there I walk out after the other experiences I've had with other employees. Staff, please stop assuming toasting is a good thing. It was Quizno's gimic, and they are no longer around for a reason. Stop toasting my sandwiches when I say no.",0
"One foot long is two meals for me. It was so packed with veggies and meat with cheese! Exactly how i asked. Very polite, consistent and fast.",0
Great Service !,2

Monica was very sweet and considerate of what I was asking for. She even stayed late after closing to make sure I was a happy customer. 10 out of 10 would recommend.,0
"Very good service, I got the attention I needed on my appointment without feeling like they were in a rush to get me done, so they could start on another client. Quiet and clean place, so I could relax",0
"Great staff. Comfortable setting, and very clean. Love to pamper myself here.",0
Nice place.friendly service.,2

Excellent Customer Service....Vi is Awesome. My nails and feet always look great when I leave. ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,0
"They staff was very nice. I took my mom, who's 82, and they were very patient & did an excellent job. Prices were reasonable.",0
The only place I trust not to grind off my natural nails when getting acrylics. Nails look great and last a long time.,0
"Great prices and ""V"" does excellent nail art.",0
This is a great place too get pedicures,0
"AWESOME, outstanding service, my wife and I love going here and having a pedicure.",0
"Beatific nail art, great place to get pedicures, manicures, acyrlic, gel, or silk nails. Caters to both men and women.",0
wont go back unless time crunched not bad but not impressed,0
"Fast, friendly, professional!",2
Clean. Friendly staff,2
This was my first visit. I arrived about 10-15 minutes early to register. The process was simple. I was with the therapist immediately. Daniel was extremely thorough and professional. His pleasant demeanor and attention to detail made me very comfortable. The entire experience was positive and informative. I left feeling confident and optimistic that the staff are experienced professionals and they knew the best direction for my rehabilitation.,0
"Day 1 intake was absolutely amazing, very kind, professional and helpful staff so far and very excited for the next 6 weeks ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª",0
"My doctors office referred me here, and they were able to get me into a next day appointment. I went in with one of my ribs out of place and got immediate relief with just one visit. My physical therapist didn't just leave it at that, though. She went ahead and checked the rest of my rib cage to make sure there were no other problem areas. She was very kind, an active listener, and took her time addressing my concerns. So glad I was referred here.",0
Completely confident I am receiving the best PT available in Anchorage. My therapist is the best. Period.,0
The PT Frazier is very understanding and knowledgeable. Explains what he is going to do in detail.,0
APT is the best. My wife and I have gone there for various issues. They are thorough in forming plans to help you on the road to recovery.,0
Everyone is very friendly and helpful,0
Loved it they were nice and knew what they were talking about and gave me step by step home instructions!,0
Loved it ! Although I could not believe .e and my nephew were the only people wearing masks!,0
"Lots of open space, fun hills to climb, multiple slides of different sizes (inxluding a rolly slide), climbing wall, sit&spin and so much more fun.",0
"Great park with lots of different areas for kids of almost all age groups! Beware there are people who walk with dogs off leash around that park often. This park is great all year round, sledding in the winter and theres a large concrete area for children to ride bikes and scooters in the summer.",0
"This park is nice and open, and it's usually a great place for the kids to burn off some energy. It also has a decent sledding hill for winter time fun.",0
"Great scenery, hilltop walk and great for dogs and kids.",0
"This is a picture from the gas station. Not a picture of the gas station. I do like the only gas station in town. They sell regular gas, diesel and propane. They have air pressure for tires most of the time.",0
Only place t I get gas,0
Cheapest gas in town.... Only the only gas in town... ðŸ˜œ,0
When I need Gallus this is the place,0
Great place great prices...,0
Only gas station in Barrow..Prices for gas is higher than the rest of America..Hint hint..,0
Great prices and service,0
The only gas station in town. A bit pricey but the service is usually fast and the gas attedants are friendly.,0
Very calm and relaxing place to have lunch. Locals can be seen here swapping stories of what's happening that week. Excellent variety of food to choose from and excellent service. Food was delicious and is a place to check out when you are in Fairbanks.,0
"Great food, excellent service and friendly staff ðŸ‘.",0
Not bad but service was very slow and there were only a few people in the restaurant. If I wanted to be ignored I'd go to a buffet.,0
I order a lot of take out from here by far best pineapple curry in town. I have only been inside once to pick up and it seemed pretty clean but it was unnervingly quiet. A restaurant with probably 10 people not one person was talking or making a sound... It was really weird,0
Bahn Thai. My favorite thai chain in Fairbanks.,0
Service was nice but I find most prices are high... Just my opinion... But yes if I can't find it cheaper I would go back ;),0
"Great place to do business, so good that we drove down from Fairbanks to purchase 2 each 4 wheelers.",0
Sales people very helpful. We will see how it goes when I get my new side by.,0
Not sure... thought Atv shops would have atvs that were not sold already in them an not machines already sold...the whole store was that way...,0
Excellent service. Fabulous products and an amazing staff!,0
They were very helpful in there.,0
Parts folks very helpful. Will see how they fix my sidexside in for repairs now.,0
Kyle is awesome. We love our new machine and the assistance he has given us. He's very friendly and customer service oriented.,0
Fresh new and already they need more and more of everything! My! My! ..Vladimir Putin may choose a visit for his King Salmon fishing vacation while here in Alaska on the KEANI PENINSULA! It let him feel a bit of HOME!,0
They put up with my father in law and the treat him great. Friendly staff that know what they are doing.,0
Just great people selling great products. Very friendly and knowledgable on everything they have. Will continue to buy from them.,0
I'm a ski-Doo guy but some Polaris stuff if nice.,0
Way over priced on parts but that's to be expected at least they can get them in a few days,0
"Awesome designs with amazing customer service! They went out of their way to print me a shirt on the spot when they didn't have my size available. Great local business using unique and original art to represent Spenard and the rest of Alaska, highly recommended!",0
"Bret is amazing, wonderful, caring and accepting. He is a catalyst for community for sure! He is such an amazing artist and very rustic, home grown and passionate. He loves to collab with community and artists and throws a great party. If you havenâ€™t been there, itâ€™s time to check it out!",0
I have several shirts from Hulin. They are all super soft and some of the coolest designs. Definitely one of my go to gifts for friends and family.,0
"Really cool, this guy is doing business in something he loves. I know from personal experience that this is a road less traveled and therefore more challenging. I wish Bret the best of business and hope he keeps me in mind in case he needs help in his print shop. Thank you for speaking with me Bret. Robert, An admiring screen printer",0
"Very cool store with a lot of unique, custom screen prints of everything from AK. Owner is a very easy-going guy. Great spot for gifts for people who love AK or who are looking for a unique souvenir from AK. 5/5 stars, highly recommended.",0
Great local shop with lots of fun designs!,0
"In on time, affordable (for uninsured me) & best of all, a protocol to save my tooth. I saw Dr Maldonado & things were clearly explained. I will return. Special shout out to her assistant, a really sweet & thoroughly professional woman, made visit enjoyable. I loved my former dentist who retired & sent records to Frost-good call.",0
"Great new dentist! Awesome staff, as usual! Been going there for 5 years. Convenient location for me & my family.",0
Staff is friendly. They have a great reminder system of calls and texts so you don't miss an appointment. I've never had to wait very long and my procedures are done sooner than expected. Not impressed with the hygienist assigned to me. She was lecturing me about dental care but her work was sloppy. Had to tell her to redo a side where I still could feel tartar during my cleaning and she did it with a satisfactory result. I've definitely had better cleaning elsewhere but one hygienist shouldn't decide my total impression of the place. My dentist was very down to earth introducing himself to me by first name. I had two fillings and a crown done and the total price of all the procedures done was amazingly affordable (with insurance).,0
They deserve all the stars they were great . They took care of my son wonderful. U do recommend this place,0
"I had great experience! Everyone was friendly, professional, and very efficient. Lovely office in a fabulous location.",0
Awesome timely professional staff,0
A fun place to shop for a variety of fabrics. Love how they display panels.,0
"Great fabrics, quilting specific shop. Worthy of your time and money if quilt obsessed. Have fun!",0
Nice local place that offers classes and Alaskan fabrics.,0
Staff is always friendly when I go there and helpful,0
Great fabrics and helpful staff,0
Great variety. Awesome quality,0
Very poor customer service. I avoid this place at all cost. I would rather shop anywhere else.,0
They had all of the supplies that my friend needed for a special order.,0
"If you're a quilter, then this place is a must.",0
"Clean bathrooms, quiet camping spots. Bring bug spray and bear spray.",0
Back Country. Few people. Seen Alaskan state trooper in a un marked Truck. Lots of Hiking and Boating. The Dragon Fly Size mosquito are no joke. Preparing for them is best not something you should get,0
Beautiful day! Watch out for bears though...,0
Great place to camp,0
"We seen three bears, no issues. We had a great night.",0
Super Awsone campground clean and well laid out,0
Best place to See wild life on skilak lake rd,0
Great fishing and camping available,0
No bears or moose not sure if that makes me glad or disappointed...,0
Heavenly. Favorite place to camp.,0
Nice remote Campground beautiful views,0
You have an under paid and ungrateful staff member. I delivered a $90 order to Shey and recieved ZERO tip.,0
"Very nice people, prompt service, and lots of availability. I will keep returning, thank you.",0
"The staff here are absolutely amazing! Very understanding and flexible with scheduling, and despite my tardiness they had a positive and friendly atmosphere throughout the entire office. They also gave me detailed information on what treatment I would need and my out-of-pocket cost, and they kept me updated throughout my entire exam with what they were doing and why. I canâ€™t thank them enough, I definitely recommend that you go to Glacier Dental for any and all dental care needs!",0
My husband had a bad toothache. It was in the evening time. So i told him find a place open late. Thank god for Glacier dental. They saw my husband as a walk in. Dr. Lee took out the 2 teeth that were bothering him. He said he slept so good. No more toothache. They also gave a good payment plan.,0
"This is the best dental experience I have had in years. I had a lot of work to be done as I had delayed getting in to see a dentist and my teeth needed descaling and several fillings. Work there was so quick and smooth and painless that I did not have even mild discomfort and my teeth after fillings, scaling, and cleaning looked like a million bucks. I have anxiety and the staff was kind and patient with me despite my fear. I left with a new respect and admiration for technological advances and for the dental profession at this clinic. Truly a pleasure, in as much as any visit to the dentist is a pleasure.",0
"Everyone was super nice, the staff is professional, and I got a great referral from here. I had a particularly hard case that I feel like could have been stopped early. It felt like they took on the case and didn't know when to quit, which is great, but the job didn't get done here in the long run. Follow ups were great. Dr. Ohsie and Dr. Abosede were both really good.",0
Worked on the wrong tooth!,0
"I walked in early in the morning without an appointment and I was able to get right into fixing my teeth. I needed 2 root canals and a bridge to be done. I'm impressed the dentist got it finished within 3-4 hours. At a different dentistry, it took the same time for one root canal. I recommend this dentistry.",0
The staff was friendly and prompt. They explained options and immediately followed through with my request. They had me scheduled at 9:30 but got me in by 9:10 to accommodate my pain issue and had me out of the chair and on my way home by 9:40. Thanks Dr. Cha!,0
"Good staff n dr n asstistant are in tuned.great experience.Thank You.Dr lee Rachael, n Amber put me in lots of pain for the better.Sincerily thank you.",0
"They are gentle and listen to the patient. I love this place and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Dr Han, Sarah, and Kira!!",0
I want to say that thank you glacier dental for doing a great job will recommend you to everyone,0
They di a really great job of making you comfortable and communicating whats going on with your health.,0
I walked in thay helped me right away thay take Medicare and walk ins thay give you what thay Ken do on your plan 5 cavity or one new crown,0
My visit was quick and friendly and was able to complete more then other clinics.,0
"Love we can walk in as a family, but...3 he wait.",0
I had Claribelle and she was very nice as well as Doctor Park he was very thoughtful of any pain,0
"Went in because my tooth was bothering me, 3 hours later my teeth where in PERFECT condition! I will never go to any other dental place in Anchorage. Customer here for life now!",0
They're good. Thanks for checking my teeth! (^_^)b,0
Excellent service all around,0
I had my teeth cleaned here and they literally cleaned them for maybe 2-3 mins and said they were done it was a joke.,0
Best detail in a timely manner in Alaska. Friendly service from Nick and Jared made me feel at home!,0
"I can't recommend this place enough, simply because of the amazing customer service I received and the care I got. I'll start with a little background, my 3 year old recently spilled a bunch of water in my car, that i thought I cleaned up but apparently left some moisture behind, as mold grew a few weeks later. I researched car detailing and saw that this place had a bunch of great reviews, and so I scheduled online for a detailing package. Super easy process and got in for a time right away. Well, me being a space case, I showed up yesterday morning thinking my appt was that day at 9 am. It wasn't, it was for today. The man working offered to let me leave my car there until the next day, although I said I'd just come back tomorrow, I appreciated the understanding and the offer. Long story short, my husband would not be able to watch our children the full time it would take for my original package, so I showed up at 9 am this morning and asked if it would be possible to just take care of the mold spot today, and then I would reschedule the full detailing for a later date. The man was very understanding and said that we could do that, and within 5 minutes took my car back, and not even 10 minutes later had it done and the mold fully gone. This alone would have warranted the 5 star, but then when I tried to pull out my wallet to pay, he told me there was no cost, because it only took him a few minutes. Seriously, I couldn't believe it. Anyways, go here. I will definitely be coming back and now so will my husband with his vehicle.",0
The absolute BEST detailing shop in all of Alaska HANDS DOWN.,0
"They did a pretty good job. It wasn't quite flawless, but they did squeeze me into their schedule so I'll forgive them a bit. I wish they would ask what they believe is a fair price rather than ask for a tip on top of their pricing. The experience as a whole was good though. I would consider doing business with them again in the future.",0
Incredible service at an amazing cost. Scheduled the pickup and drop off add on which made the experience a breeze. Could hardly believe my eyes when I saw how well the car had been cleaned. Highly recommend Morris for your detailing needs.,0
These guys are legit. Got me in Thursday night and ready Friday morning. Prices are the best around and the work is QUALITY. If you need your car looking new again go here.,0
"Morris Auto Detail has exceeded my expectations! The staff are very friendly and professional, and the owners are a fantastic team! My '15 CR-V was trashed by my kids, and now there is no sign that I have kids. Looks newer than when I drove it off the lot new. I highly recommend Morris, you won't be disappointed!",0
These guys worked so hard to ensure my satisfaction I really have no choice but to come here for all of my auto detail needs!! As an Uber driver my car is my office and it needs to be clean and professional; This team truly delivered!,0
"Did a good job on the interior cleaning of my car, rates are reasonable, and I got my car back the same day.",0
The truck was perfect when they were done with it!,0
Great job. My car is like new again.,0
Just had my subaru detailed and they really did an amazing job. They got out stains that the other shop I went to didn't! The customer service was awesome. I won't go anywhere else.,0
"Outstanding customer service! There was a little confusion on what exactly we wanted to happen, but Aaron made it work out for us. Very professional, and not to mention their work is phenominal! Thanks!",0
Great work and VERY fair!!,0
"I had my car detailed by these guys. I've been detailing vehicles of all sizes for around 10 years. Exterior- Body had a significant amount of wax that was not fully removed. Rims still had wax to be removed. Under the hoodWas still dirty needed a better wipe down before dressing was applied. Interior- Skipped the headliner paid extra for that. Both trays for change and misc items were still dusty with small grains of dirt. The windows all around looked like they had been wiped with wax microfibers, they're more streaky then when we had it picked up before the detail. Picked up 40 MINS LATE. Let's talk business here for a second..If a customer pays you a car payment to detail their vehicle. You should be treating as if it's your vehicle. You know how nice your want it to be if it belonged to you. If you're given from 9:00am to almost 4:00pm To complete the vehicle, there's no excuses for.. Dirty windows..Dirty consoles..45percent of wax not wiped off..dirt on the hood.. Now I'll say something nice. Thank you for being able to pick up the car. THEY ALWAYS LOOK BETTER AFTER THEN BEFORE THE DETAIL. I could argue with the owner on this post but I've already seen the responses to the negative reviews..It's more of a battle of experience as opposed to a helping hand or a correction toward corner cutting mistakes.",0
"Friendly helpful and knowledgeable staff, worth the money spent",0
"Car came back clean, but wet, and took much longer than I was told. Two weeks later, and my car still hasn't fully dried. Additionally, these guys act like we have another ride or a second car. Dog smell still around. My own personal goods weren't returned either--I had to hunt those down. Not super amused. I'm probably not coming back. I don't recommend that you do either.",0
"Aaron Morris at Morris Auto Detail rocks! This is the 4th time I have had him detail my vehicle and he never ceases to amaze me. His company picks my car up at work and returns it promptly when they are finished and his attention to detail is impeccable! I swear he uses a Qtip it's so clean... Honest, fair and affordable prices. I wouldn't take my vehicle or refer my family and friends to anyone else!",0
"Excellent service, very professional and honest.The owners are going above and beyond to help the customer.highly recommend",0
"This shop offers honesty and integrity, something hard to find in this industry. The owners ensure customer satisfaction and I will always take my vehicles back to Morris!",0
Morris Auto Detail did an impeccable job on my vehicle looks brand new again I had mounds of dog hair on the inside and they were able to get every inch of it out thanks Morris detail you guys are the best,0
"For a really clean car, visit these guys.",0
"I had my silverado detailed yesterday, and this place is no joke, they made my truck look better than when i first bought it. Aaron and his crew were very proffesional and they will have me back!",0
"Fast, friendly, cost effective & thorough!",0
Wish they had more time to return calls.,0
I found their lawyers to be professional and extremely competent.,0
I was so please with how Richard and Jon Marc treated and represented me. I was always treated with respect and dignity by their whole staff. I would recommend this firm to anyone that is need of legal services. I felt like they were respected at the court house which in my eyes is big if you are trying for the best possible outcome for your situation.,0
As long as I get someone on the phone and have thier immidiate attention.. All goes well.. Good luck.,0
Igor and support staff are exceptional. TYSM.,0
"They do not care about natives, try calling, said that they will return call, never did! Said they will call next week, next week never come, still waiting to hear from the lawyer...",0
"If we could give them a negative review number we would. Our lawyer ""FORGOT"" to show up for our court appearance. Kindly, the judge had us call him, it took him over an hour to get to the court house while we waited. He showed up looking rumpled, like he had just rolled out of bed after a night of partying. To help us, he read his notes from ...our one and only visit with him... off his cell phone to the judge. He didn't bother to put us on his calendar or review our case. Embarrasing and terrible, we couldn't be more disappointed.",0
They all work for the state n will always be bias,0
Extremely rude people at thus while facility,0
My lawyer is dope,0
Went in for a cleaning today. I've been going here for many many years. Jamie did a great. She cleaned my teeth last time. It's always nice to have the same friendly person.,0
Zero wait! Amazing dentist and hygienists.,0
The Doctors and staff here are the most friendly and communicative dental professionals I have ever seen. I look forward to visiting here,0
"This office is one of the best in Anchorage. They care about their patients, make you feel welcome, comfortable and safe, and provide great dental care in a very professional atmosphere. They have stayed true to the practices that Dr. Mark Laurin began so many years ago in this office!",0
I was very pleased i had to look for new dentist because were I was going he was only in office once a week and after three months of not getting work done that needed done I googled dentist and found this one I like the people at this office and think ill be pleased with them,0
Great professional dental service. The dentist noticed & fixed several mistakes done by other dentists.,0
Very friendly very professional I can't I don't know to put in words how comfortable I felt there and then having doctor massey and Stacey join that group was the icing on the cake so yeah I like it and I to pass the word on to all my friends so thank you I don't know how to leave a like comment but yeah I like a lot so I don't know where the check mark goes in the question but I reviewed what I said and it had 0 likes so this is in a like I don't know what is,0
"Friendly staff, welcoming office. I always feel like everyone here truly cares about their patients. All the treatments and billing is always thoroughly explained. The office is modern, super clean and has a great view of the mountains!",0
I did a walk in for cut and color. My color is perfect! I love it! My hair is fine and curly. I was given a great cut that worked with my hair. The visit made my day.,0

Great cut and color for a very fair price!,0
Experienced stylist and great at making suggestions,0
Great with my 81 mom who has Alzheimer's.,0
This place and my stylist saved my hair. Thank you Regis!,0
I only went in there to ask about an basic haircut and I found out it was too expensive so I left.,0
Way over priced,2
Absolutely amazing service! Honestly one of the best haircuts I've had! If I could I'd give you a 6 star review. Quick and effective too,0
Love the atmosphere and added bonus to see the owner's dogs!! Tim is the only person my 6 year old son will let cut his hair.,0
Best haircut I've gotten in the last year and a half. Really nice people. Really decent prices,0

Wonderful loving group of people.,0
A loving congregation,2
Wonderful church Wonderful people,0
I did not appreciate the US postal person delivering mail to my familyâ€˜s house in Anchorage. The driver threw the box out the door and the box was damaged because of his laziness to get out of the vehicle and put the box by the door. Because of his laziness the items that I bought for my family was damage,0
"I agree with the other posts. This is the worst postal station in the United States. It doesn't matter what time of day that you go there, they only have one station open with the line going out the door. The rest of the crew is in the back having a party. No one gives a hoot about servicing the customer. They absolutely refuse to answer the telephone. It's no wonder the US Postal Service is loosing billions of dollars a year. They should shut this ""Hell Hole"" down.",0
In the morning time's the line's are not very bad. Sometimes they are slow at opening on time but the lines thin out a lot. 1/5 star for lack of employee's. If they had a few more at the front there it would get more done.,0
Employee are very helpful,0
Ok first time every mailing a package out and bolth woman at the front counter... Where very rude and unhelpful... Took me a half a hour just to send a small package out.. Never going here again... Should of went to Fed ex!!,0
1 or 2 lazy humans working there. I drive 10 mins to the nearest USPS just to avoid this hell hole. This is where anarchy breeds from!,0
1 more USPS station,0
Most of the time ok service,0
This is a great little spot for a quick drink or game of pool! You can cook your own steaks in there as well! Cool joint.,0

Typical dive bar,2
Wonderful alaska life at here.,0
"Friendly staff, great gift store, fun and informative exhibits, free trip planning information for public lands near and far, and NPS passport stamps makes this an easy addition to any trip to downtown Anchorage. The least convenient part about the center is the fact that you will have to go through security as it is housed in a federal building. Love that gift shop purchases support Alaskaâ€™s public lands!",0
Great to visit a huge data of nearby land available here .Thanks staff for their efforts.,0
"Nice place to spend some time and watch shows. Friendly, skilled and helpful staff.",0
This is a great place to get a great meal (and beer). Alecia gave us amazing service despite how incredibly busy the place was. I would recommend stopping in for one of there many flavorful menu items.,0

"Our kayaking trip was one of the best parts of our trip to Alaska! Jamie and Bryan were fantastic guides. We saw bald eagles, sea otters and sea lions while kayaking! I highly recommend Liquid Adventures!",0
Very trustworthy adventure company. The guides absolutely amazing and are very well trained. One of the best things you can do in Alaska! Iceberg Kayaking and Ice Climbing are the best things you can do.,0
Two separate comments 1: for Liquid Adventure itself. 1/5. Really bad. Lunch was bad. they said they will supply snacks which they didnt. 2: the guide. 5/5. he was nice. helped us with lot of lessons and photos. gave good rest and tips. at the end hot chocolate.,0
"Contientious, knowledgeable, and full of adventure, Liquid Adventures is a great option for anyone looking to paddle Resurrection Bay near Seward. I really enjoyed our rainy day kayak trip that could have been miserable, but the guides were amazing. So fun!",0
Great stuffs and great adventures. Good prices as well,0
"After the earthquake, my sister-in-law was helicoptered out after paddle boarding.",0
This is an awesome place to drink non-alcoholic soda and had free pizza with our soda purchase when we stopped in.,0
Was there after veteran day event and I rarely go as not much of drinking alcohol or pull tab player..I do like it for the companionship of my fellow veterans,0
A very small but totally awesome VFW with lots of helpful people that do a lot for the veterans. Met the auxiliary president and her husband the Quartermaster. Had supper on Tuesday night with some really nice people and had some awesome food.,0
Great company with a very inviting atmosphere. Some of the friendliest people I have met.,0
Great Place for fellowship,0
Nice place. Didn't care for the cigarette smell inside,0
Absolutely a great place to spend a few leisurely minutes and great for children as well. Rich history abounds within the port. A walk will reveal all the best treasure Alaska has to offer.,0
It cute little and just very relaxing. Also could relax and go eat convenient location.,0
Love this place,2
"Great place to sit and watch the world go by, have lunch etc. Very clean park, nice benches, well cut grass.",0

"These Shout Out's are for Ms. Karen and Reggie ðŸ‘. Ms. Karen, you listened ðŸ˜¤, researched and corrected an error with professionalism, value and humor.

You show pride in your work, professionalism and understand excellent job values. I Thank You both. Testy",0
"Could not even get past the first 2 minutes of phone conversation when I realized that I needed to go somewhere else. If the receptionist is any example of the business, they suck. Simple as that.",0
I'm am so glad I called. They got me in the same day and handled every thing in a professional manner and a smile! I won't be calling anyone else for plumbing or heating. TOP NOTCH service is hard to come by now a days! Additional Review Sitesclick to collapse contents,0
Brian Sperry was very prompt and professional.,0
Needed a new water heater and repair work for furnace. This company has great people working for them. Always comfortable around the workers in my house. James' work looks like gold. *Edit. Reggie was the first to see all and let me know what needed to get done for inspection. Thank you guys,0

The baristas are friendly. Theres outdoor seating. Bike rack. With the staff amking all the noise going to the bathroom its infuriating. Came back a couple weeks later Then i had to wait for the barista ..to get finish putting someone elses egg muffin in the microwave,0
Nice for a Starbucks. Gracious baristas!,0

"Was easy to set up an appointment and get a very reasonable quote on my dented D pillar. Took less than 2 hours to fix, he even took care of a couple of door dings and he still charged me less than the quote. Can't even tell where the hand sized dent used to be. If the paint ain't cracked, call Jason the Dent Dude! Pictures are worth a thousand words, so I'll shut up now.",0
"The shop is kind of hard to find, once I found it I was greeted by a kind, friendly and knowledgeable person who took care of my dent in a timely, professional manner at a very cost effective way. I strongly recommend him to anyone who has a dent.",0
Nice guy. Honest.,2
"Just had a dent pulled out of my car. I canâ€™t even tell where the dent was. Done pretty fast and the price was reasonable. If you want to support small business in AK, go put a dent in your car and have this guy fix it!",0
Used this Dude several times over the years. He can fix a pretty bad dent in your truck without reconstruction. Looks as good as new when done!,0
"The Dent Dude was awesome. Some idiot at my job put their door into mine....Even though I go out of my way to avoid this type of stuff. They managed to get me. This crease was one of those light ones, that is hard to see in daylight, but in your face at night. The Dent Dude was done in minutes. Now my car is back to looking brand-new! Thank you!! I highly recommend!",0
"I've had Jason fix 3 dents on my Toyota Tacoma, 2 crease type dents on my tailgate and another on my drivers door. He does awesome work and I can't even tell those dents were ever there before.",0
"I've run a local body shop for years and have used Jason for over a decade. His skills at preforming paintless dent repairs are second to none. I've had many customers chose PDR repairs due to the savings and are amazed at how the vehicle looks after he has done his magic. I like to think I have a very talent eye for finding imperfections and the typical repair that I see from Jason comes out flawless. Sometimes this is not possible, but the result are always acceptable. Especially considering how expensive Body Work can be. THIS OFTEN THE RIGHT ROUTE TO GO. I highly recommend this skilled technician and you should trust him with your vehicle too.",0
"I ran over my neighbor's mailbox and dented the hood on my Toyota 4Runner. The Dent was about the size of a lunch plate and was deep. I was impressed that kind of dent could get pulled out pointless. Jason at the Dent Dude was awesome- he was fast, professional, and did a great job!",0
Very well equipped shop and device department. Great quality fabrication and customization.,0
Always great service and very friendly,0
I was happy with the job.,0

"Just to be honest right out of the gate, I am a member of LCOH and am currently on the Council. But if you are looking for an open, accepting, and welcoming place to experience God's love for the world, please join us for worship on Sundays at 10 AM. If you enjoy bible study, come in at 9.

"Never open when google or their posted time on the door says they should be open. We keep trying to get in to get some things taken care of, but every time we come (when theyâ€™re supposed to be open) doors are locked and they are closed.",0
While I've been aware and have had to change my IDs with previous moves etc I don't need to be talked down too. When you are asked if our want a real ID or state ID expect a questioning look. I'm there for a drivers license I'm pretty sure that's a real ID. And no I'm sorry I was not aware that AK now has two different IDs either a federal approved or none federal approved one. Why would you have a non approved one? Rudeness is not worth going back..,0
Always a quick turn around. Helpful staff. Much better and a DMV,0
Fastest DMV trip I've ever had and the service was amazing. Shelby helped me out and gave a lot of great tips on the local area since I am new to thr area!,0
Be ready for a line longer than a real DMV with insanely high fees. Would not recommend.,0
Best customer service hands down,0
Very professional and fast service!!,0

No need for a made-up review. Alaska Airlines truly is a one-of-a-kind commuter air service company. I ðŸ’š Alaska Airlines.,0
"Baggage team doesn't know how to load the belt. Stuff is always falling off. Ravn and grant both have a larger terminal waiting area, WiFi and working vending machines but Alaska doesn't. Past TSA area needs a bathroom and a water fountain.",0
"This is the 5th flight I have had with them, they are outstanding. I WILL be using them more than before for sure.",0
Not bad. The security people were nice. They stop boarding like 20-30 mins before the flight so make sure you're there early to check in bags and go through security. There can be a pretty long line sometimes.,0
"Everyone is very helpful on the flight, ticket counter,baggage",0
Alaska is by far the best airline to fly with. Friendly employees and safe travels with them.,0
Always have had great service.,0
Have a great millage program,0
Alaska is by far the best airline!!,0
Ok but hate going through security,0

"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this little shop! Quality merchandise and friendlt knowledgeable service.",0
"Fun. Just... fun. The daily specials menu was delightful, and the staples they carry regularly appeared just as awesome. The fact that Eva herself popped out of the kitchen to make recommendations and joke with her customers was also a plus on the service side. Outstanding experience.",0
Cupcakes are to die for... my wife and kids loved the chocolate cupcakes. The kids also liked the apple topping one. The staff are all kind and warm hearted. They are very busy on holidays so prepare to wait. They baked the dozen I wanted while I waited. Highly recomend this cupcake bakery.,0
"Really, really wanted to like this place. Iâ€™ve given it a few tries, but the cupcakes are always priced above their quality. We paid $15 for a 4 pack of day old cupcakes that were extremely dry. I would have been really upset if we had paid $40+ for the dozen cupcakes of that quality. If you go here, you need to get a guarantee that the cupcakes are FRESH.",0
This place is the best all cup cake are great. Cupcake pricy but it all made in house. Once you taste the products you will understand,0
"Extremely nice staff. Cupcakes are AMAZING, tastebuds explosion â™¡",0
"The frostings on the 6 i got was 2"" of lard. The cake on the were drt and dense. The only one that was good was the carrot cupcakes. I WOULD NOT recommend this at all.",0
"Love Eva's! Awesome cupcakes and she's made two custom birthday cakes for me so far, both were amazing :)",0
"Good desserts, friendly and prompt service.",0
Hands down the best cup cake I ever had! And such a good service!ðŸ’–,0
Love this place â¤,0
Itâ€™s beautiful and well maintained,0
Very interesting to see fresh water flowing into salt water,0
SO SO beautiful here. You can get a lot of cool and unique rocks too,0
"In my opinion, this is the best beach around! There is a short and easy trail to the beach. It is so beautiful here! There is a stream that kids can play in but make sure you keep a close eye on them because it can be swift at times!",0
It was great warm water and mud was warm also,0
Great fun in the woods with family and friends.,0
"If you are bringing your kids, bring your sandals so they can play in the creek and build driftwood bridges.",0
The lil hike back is worth it!,0
A beautiful place to exist.,0
Most beautiful place to live! Always have some amazing view to see whether it's sunny or raining sideways!,0
So much fun to ride with my friends on a ATV in the winter months up to the top of the mountain,0
Great place. Lots of safety supplies. They offer a lot of different classes like CPR/ First aid. They also rent supplies if you need them. They can put together very nice first aid kits for your work or job site as well.,0
"I had to take the CPR and first aid course for my new job, and he was very informative, easy to understand and made us feel confident in saving a life if the need ever arises. He offered refreshments too which is nice. I love his mix of humor in his slideshows to ease up the class. While I give 5 stars, I do want to mention that I know snakes aren't in Alaska, but I wish a little more was covered in that area concerning snake bites in case we travel outside of Alaska. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the class and I will recommend to anyone in the Anchorage area.",0
The class was not just informative we actually had fun.,0
"Jon did such a wonderful job at reading the room, and keeping the class entirely engaged! Time flew by, and we had such a good time with the hands on instruction, as well as interesting slides, and fun stories. Jon was professional, but had a way of making sure everyone enjoyed their time. I really appreciated everything he had to share, and most importantly, he was a wonderful teacher. I was previously certified, but Jon blew me out of the water with new information, as well as real life action. I left that afternoon ready to save peoples lives, not only was I ready, but I wanted to! He really knows his stuff! If you're looking for a great way to get certified in First Aide, Adult, and infant CPR, He's the guy to go to!.",0
Very fun and knowledgeable. The guy that does the class has a great sense of humor. Would definitely recommend this place for your cpr/first aide training.,0
We had a private class of 12 people and the instruction was excellent. It was extremely thorough and we all found it very beneficial. We will definitely be using this company in the future.,0
This is my second time through the CPR/AED course with Jon and he always finds a way to make it fun and engaging. I won't take a course anywhere else.,0
The class was really educational and fun! Thank you!,0
Stellar experience. Had CPR class with Michael and he had a very engaging presentation. Everyone in the class seemeed to enjoy it.,0
"Jon runs an excellent class. He covers new thought processes and reasons why old treatments and methodologies have been moved on from. Good pace, fun relaxing environment. Highly recommend!!",0
My First Aid/CPR class was great! It was informative and entertaining. I have been certified for years and still learned a lot!,0
Jon was the best!,0
Good informative training. Been to many First aid and CPR classes and enjoyed this one the most. Thanks John,0
Great experience with taking the Mandt class that was offered through this company.,0
"I respect the baristas, but damn. If you're going to spend over $5 on a coffee it should be strong and complex. Every drink I've had tastes like milk and they don't have any of the syrups that every other coffee shop has. Where's my Bob Marley or my Nutty Irishman? I'd rather make my own coffee, sorry.",0
The coffee is never made the same. Too inconsistent. Let's get it right people!!,0
"I have a Favorite Drink that ""My Girl"" (night crew) that works there remembers exactly how I enjoy it. She ALWAYS makes it PERFECTLY! Friendly and polite staff.",0
Fabulous coffee to get your morning started warm me up,0
Delicious coffee! Friendly and nice people,0
I just wish they had more sugar free flavors.,0
Always good and the same reliable service you can expect this to be that quick refreshing pitstop.,0
It's your typical Starbucks. Nothing more nothing less.,0
Good meeting place and some tasty expensive coffee.,0
"Good coffee, nuff said!",0
My 2 day old burnt coffee taste better then 90% of their menu. I don't know what happened but the quality has gone way downhill. That with long wait times = get a red bull or make it at home.,0
Great cup of coffee every time and super friendly baristas ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜‰,0
I love their coffee,0
Was a great place with great staff,0
I love Starbucks!! The baristas are friendly & always make my coffee just the way I like it!,0
They where nice and it was so convenient to stop,0
Service and coffee is great,0
Only place to get an iced vanilla latte,0
Great place for coffee,0
Way over priced,2
I loved it,2
Feed My Soul,2
Starbucks is too liberal,0
I choose not to support this business because the support taxes other business.,0
"Lots of clever gifts in here. Very enthusiastic proprietor! Stickers, novelty spices, essential oils, decor, knit scarves.",0
Such a great little shop.,0
"There's a little bit of something for everyone here! Gifts for loved ones, or yourself. :) The owner is so friendly and helpful you'll leave with a big smile on your face.",0
A very nice and homey feel you get when you walk in. The staff are very knowledgeable on their products they sell. And they are friendly and attentive.,0
Lots of great stuff from many different vendors and local artists.,0
"Had a church party with a nice lawn. room enough to set up a volleyball net, bubble table, play dough table and room for throwing Frisbee. The gazebo picnic area gave us plenty of room to eat and stay out of the rain when it rained occasionally.",0
Beautiful green grass and quiet. Was a great place to take my rabbit to bunny around while we kicked back in the ever so green thick grass.,0
"Probably our favorite park. Nice and open, great visibility and usually tend to be pretty clean. I did notice that there tends to be jackets and sweaters left on the ground lately.",0
Love it. Great for kids,0
A more discreet park but all the fun toys for the kids. Even has a large covered picnic area for parties.,0
Its a small park and it sometimes suffers from lack of parking spots. But it has ample space for kids to run and play. Especially when they aren't using the playground equipment. I eish there was more for adults to do like mock workout equipment or even a metal elliptical would be great. But there are plenty of benches and a porta potty in the area. So its a good place to visit.,0
Great place for kids to play,0
"Art Sutch has a tremendous wealth of knowledge about both the technical and creative aspects of photography and readily shares it with people who come to his shop. While his prices aren't always competitive with what you can find online, the experience and skill he provides more than make up for it. Whether you're looking for creative input, tips on where to shoot, or a new body or lens, this is the place to go in Juneau.",0
"Real nice, I recommend this place. Nice scenery and beautiful trip.",0
"I had a pet emergency. Island to island staff are responsive and kind. They explained everything so well. It'll be a while before the dog fully recovers, but I feel confident and competent in my ability to help her on the route to recovery because of the immense amount of education I was given while I was there. Thank you",0
Nice Staff & Deku was comfortable which never happens,0
"Love, love, love, Dr Marna and crew.",0
"These people are amazing! My sons dog was in a car accident, they went above and beyond to make this girl as comfortable as possible. 2 years later they still ask about her. Your fur babies become their fur babies.",0
I've only been there a couple times but staff and facility is very nice.,0
"They really care about your pets, you know your animal is in good hands.",0
Very wonderful and caring people..,0
Great vet and great staff!,0
Friendly and helpful,2
"It's always a good start to the day when your teeth feel clean! A huge thank you to Cari and the rest of Dr. Penfield's staff for not only doing the amazing job they always do in their normal care, but for also being diligent in their extra precautions to keep me healthy and safe.",0
"I used to go here for my dental treatment a couple years ago, but no longer. The staff here always made me feel like they were trying to fill a sales quota for expensive and unnecessary dental treatments. Maybe they needed to fill a quota to pay for the cost of TVs at every massaging dental chair (just a theory). They really push aesthetic treatments here, even if they don't improve your dental health. The first question they asked my wife was: ""Is there anything about your smile you'd like to change?"" I know some people that love this place for all of the bells and whistles, but I simply don't. Fortunately, I found another dentist in Eagle River I really like that is more my speed. If you're all about dental aesthetics and need a TV and massage dental chair to get through a dental cleaning, this place is totally right for you. But if you're looking for a place that provides no nonsense, reserved, and conservative dental treatment, you might want to try another dentist in town.",0
"I tell everyone about this place, they are great! The staff is friendly helpful and attentive. The facility is modern and equipped with all the latest technology. The technicians and dentist are on it they make you feel comfortable. They make going to the dentist feel like a day at the spa :-) complete with a complementary moisturizing hand wax and message.",0
"Thay have soft touch, I normally hate going but the make it easy.",0
A persable experience with great customer service it made her and if phenomenal dentist. The facility was immaculate and really put me at ease,0
Super fantastic staff and Doctors! Always make me feel at home.,0
"I have been using Legacy since they opened, and love them!!",0
"Clean facility, friendly staff, exceptional service.",0
"Great dentist with warm, friendly supporting staff",0
"Great service. Only needed minor work, but they did above and beyond--including a thorough cleaning of the interior. It looks brand new, which is saying a lot since we haven't had a chance to vacuum it in a while. :-) They were accurate and honest about when it would be finished, called for verbal consent before touching it after the tow truck dropped it off, and thoroughly explained the damages. Impressive business!",0
Nicest front desk girl I have ever met,0
They do excellent work,0
Awesome customer service,2
"Tasia is awesome and 907 Tags & Titles is the best, fastest way to get things done if you don't want to brave the DMV (who in their right mind does?). I've used them twice now for title transfers and registrations, and both times I was in and out. -Edward",0
"Fast and helpful service, beats the DMV by a long shot.",0
"If you are looking for a quick, in and out experience, for much less than you would spend at other DMV alternative places....you have to go here!",0
Very nice lady who will bend over backwards to help solve any problem with titles and registration.,0
Absolutely the best place to get your vehicle legal needs met.,0
"I didnt catch the name of the lady who helped me, but I'm pretty sure she's the owner. She was super informative, and efficient. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know",0
This is my place please stop by.,0
"What a nice Lady, very friendly and got my things done fast. I recommend 907 Tags to everyone.",0
"Forget where you were thinking about going. This is THE place and the rating is 100% accurate. Super fast, knowledgeable, informative, and most importantly, friendly. The exact opposite of the DMV",0
Absolutely helpful and quick service.,0
Very friendly and speedy service always refering people here for there needs Thanks 907 for helping me and giving great service,0
"This lady is amazing, she gets things DONE! Super friendly person and convenient location to boot",0
What a sweet lady.,0
Closed during the posted business hours....,0
"I had a great experience here. Amazing service, doctor help me and made me back to normality in couple days. Price is really reasonable and affordable. I am 100% satisfy!",0
"I really enjoy coming to Arctic Chiropractic on Lake Otis. They are very friendly and the place is always kept clean. As soon as you walk in receptionist greets you and they are friendly too. My therapist Dr. Lisa, Larry and the new lady thatâ€™s working there is really awesome. They all probably think I talk too much. But no matter what theyâ€™ll listen and talk to me. The Masseuse Rudi, Kimberly and Tomas they are awesome too. I always look forward for my massage. Thank you all for what you do, I appreciate you all. God bless you all.",0
"I love this Arctic office! I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends and family. Dr. Lisa is the best physical therapist in ALASKA! She has helped provide me with awesome exercises, rehab instructions and the DRY NEEDLING is incredible for knees and low back pain. I was recommend to this office by a friend and I had no idea that they were located all over the state. I was ever able to have massage therapy to help treat the sore muscle in my legs and back.",0
"Love this place and the staff. My physical therapist Lisa Radley is young , and great at explaining everything in a way for me to understand and shes cool too! My massage therapist Thomas is great. I went here previously for nerve damage in my right arm which they improved. I'm pregnant now and they're helping with carpal tunnel in both my hands and back pain.They're the best and taught me some things about my nerve damage and the graston technique which I use at home and share with others . Ana is the sweetest receptionist. I HIGHLY recommend the location because of the staff",0
I love it and improve my Physical abilities to work on exercise with trainer and feel good about massage therapy wonderful .,0
"I was disappointed that Chiropractic wasn't covered for Health Benefits. Also, they don't have the other fields that I suggested to making a great primary care of one. They are one sided to Natural but don't mix Medical. Not flexible.",0
"Dr. Adam is the best chiropractor, amazing job he does. They also treat you like family. Thank you!",0
"Super friendly staff, will definitely tell others!",0
Great place and friendly Staff,0
Welcoming love of Christ flows. Great praise and community share times.,0
Great NA meeting here.,0
Genuine folks. Real love. Unconditional acceptance.,0
Very inclusive and wonderful church. We are new but felt very welcomed.,0
Went for a craft bazaar. Felt welcome . Nice people.,0
Great spiritual center,2
Great recovery here,2
Great church service,2
Kim is great! Iâ€™ve been a customer for 18 years and she has always been awesome!,0
"Kim is excellent. She is fast, but very thorough. I have been going to her for several years and have not had a bad haircut. I recommend her highly.",0
"They do a great haircuts. She remembers her customers, so when I visit, unless I want something different, she gets my style right every time.",0
My first time going here. Wanted a haircut. Had really long hair and wanted to cut it really short. I walked in with a photo from the internet and wow did they do an amazing job! I love it so much and will definitely be going back! Great place!. Even for kids when they were doing my hair a man and his child (around 3 or 4) came in and they did an amazing job distracting the boy to cut his hair. It was amazing,0
It is a great place to get your hair cut I go thar all the time,0
"Good food, quick service. Very Alaskan",0
My husband (who has thick Asain hair) really needed a haircut and we were in a big time crunch. Kim did an amazing job and did it fast! We will definitely be coming back!,0
I have been going to Kim for 20 years. She is fast and amazing!,0
Got finessed. Its one thing to please the customers but if you know something is going to turn out wrong then have some guts and tell the client.,0
Best place in town!,0
Kim is the best!,0
"I had to put my 18 year old dog down. Dimond Animal hospital/ midnight sun clinic, was amazing. The clinical staff was awesome. I knew they cared about my pain and wanted what was best for my pet. I wish the front desk people had been as compassionate... they were indifferent. My experience during this horrific time was so positive, we have chosen to return with future pet needs.",0
I brought my kitten their turns out she is a he lol but excellent work wait time is causal,0
They took the best care of my pup and i couldn't have asked for a better staff.,0
My cat died here they were sooo sweet,0
Great vet and was able fo examine my fur baby . Dr. Varmin is awesome.! Downside is they dont have payment plans but nice other than that.,0
Went here because I thought my dog was going in to labor. I called first and asked how much it would cost they told me it would be 70 for the check up and additional cost for X-rays I asked them how much and that I donâ€™t have much money they said to come in. I did my dog isnâ€™t in labor but they wanted 200 for the X-ray which I didnâ€™t have. So I just paid for the vet talking with me and they didnâ€™t even do much for my dog. Then she tells me that all dogs should be fixed. Their clinic is dirty and not that clean. They didnâ€™t even take her temperature like they should have. They looked at me like I was to broke to have a dog. I will never be going here again.,0
They are great with pets,0
I like them.,2
Denise is super awesome and has always tried to work with me.i in fact am a repeat tenant.the prices are kinda high but they dont want you to loose your belongings .she is very communicative. Love this place,0
"Great people, great prices. My go to storage facility.",0
"Professional staff, they handle logistics well, I've always loved the location right next to highway",0
"Despite what others say about storage places this is a good one to be at. They are curtious And understanding but still have a business to run. The lady is always nice when I come in, even when frustrated or busy. The sizing of unit to price is a good ratio. The elevators are a bit slow but it's great when moving big loads that are top heavy.",0
The units are well managed and maintained structurally. The price for units are reasonable. They have a after hours online payment website. Security of property is taken seriously.,0
Really good people and lots of different sizes for your needs.,0
Just bought some dryers from a friend who has storage there,0
I love this place they remembered me from 10 years ago and are still a great place to store things that you don't want to get rid of but don't want to clutter your home,0
Two years there. No problems.,0
"Very nice people, lots of storage options available at an affordable rate.",0
This place is the worst place to store belongings. If there were a negative rating I would say negative 5 stars. They don't tell you they will not take partial payments so don't have any accidents and miss a payment cause you will have to pay it in full plus all the late fees. They refuse to accept payments unless it's in full. This place sucks.,0
Great security. Spacious storage unit,0
The blond lady has no business etiquette. She's a complete Looney bird that is a busy body. Don't trust these people. I know too many people that had bad experiences. They need a negative star.,0
Clean Storage with Easy Entrance and Exit.,0
Good place to store your stuff. Well Secure and nice clean storages of different sizes.,0
Good place! Great rates!,0
Reasonable prices. Nice people!,0
"Open on sundays ,saved my stuff being in the rain.",0
Prices are great property well-secured clean,0
Great secured storage.,2
Great for storage of any kind,0

Awesome to find a Radio Shack here in Valdez. I made a purchase from them. They are dog friendly too (as long as they get to pet...LOL,0
Wonderful place to shop. Customer service is great.,0
They always get me what I need,0
What can I say it's a RadioShack store. great staff,0
"Good place to shop for Valdez, Alaska",0
Big improvement with their service,0

"Enjoyed my breakfast burrito, latte and Americano",0
"Quick and friendly service with good prices, good drive-in entrance from both ways, clean appearance, and knowledgeable staff. Remembers customers very well if you have a unique preference, which makes getting your coffee in the morning even quicker.",0
Best place in Soldotna to get a Mocha and have it actually taste like a Mocha. Don't forget your punch card!!,0
"Woman Owned, Small Business, Good Coffee, Great Baristas!",0
good coffee some of the girls are pretty hot good all around.,0
Hot coffee and cold drinks,0
Love libraries. I sure hope they aren't extinct in 20 years,0
"Fantastic modern library with great comfortable sitting areas conducive to reading and studying. Spacious and well lit. Big windows with excellent views. Separate children and teen areas. A family favorite with good programs and diverse educational activities. As a plus, they sport a complete bicycle repair station on their premises (see pictures)",0
"A great place with great people :) they have all sorts of games, movies, and audiobooks",0
"Mendenhall Valley Public Library aka Juneau Public Library - Valley Branch is one of three branch libraries of Juneau is it's crown jewel. Located in a beautiful mountain scene backdrop, next to Thunder Mountain High School. It has a wonderful architecture design. Free WiFi that offers a fast broadband connection unlike it's downtown branch with it's anemic unacceptably slow connection speed. The longest hours of it's three branches.",0
"Very modern library. Has WiFi, you can rent a Wii U, there are computers available and study rooms. This is all in addition to the normal movie rentals, books, audio books and the like. Quiet place to hang if you're looking to relax or study.",0
"Great study rooms with large screen tv, hdmi hookup. Ample power/USB ports throughout the library. Wifi.",0
Not so quiet....,2
Nice people. Good price. Got my beard trimmed it was a pretty relaxing experience. I'll go again,0
Was very impressed with everything. Their online scheduling was super intuitive and easy. Love to see another small business dragging Alaska kicking and screaming out of the 1980s. Cory did a great job on my hair and beard. Will definitely be coming back!,0
"Cory did an awesome job. My first time there. Their service is like none other. Top shelf. Their prices are low enough that you can also give a nice tip, and you should. Help support your local folks.",0
First time in and definitely will be back. Excellent service.,0
Great place to get a hair cut and beard trimmed.,0
Blows Great Clips out of the water. Best experience I've had across Alaska so far. I will be going here for the rest of the time I'm in Alaska. Have you ever walked into a hair cutting business and been asked if you would like a beer? Highly recommend. I can't believe this is in Palmer and I took so long to go.,0
these ladies no how to give a great hair cut an beard trim I always leave silky smoothe,0
Sherri is absolutely awesome! Our schedules donâ€™t line up very often so I donâ€™t get a make it to her as much as I would like to but every time I do she does a top-notch job! She is by far the best barber Iâ€™ve done to you.,0
Couldn't ask for a better hair cut and shaved also got free beer can't ask for a better experience this place is a must.,0
Amazing good haircut and really decent prices,0
Sherri listened to what I wanted and cut my hair amazingly.,0
"I just had my first visit to this Barber shop. Not only did Sherri cut my hair better than itâ€™s ever been cut, she is very friendly, and the service was excellent.",0
Fun conversation and a great haircut/beard trim. They really know what they're doing at this place!,0
Great haircut and trim Thank you!!,0
Awesome haircut and awesome staff,0
Love this place,2
Great place to come with the kids all year round!,0
It was a bit wet but had a great time.,0
Great experience I got to go outside spend some time with my friends kid. Healthy experience.,0
"Nice place to walk dogs,skate board,clean park,basketball, tennis,Wednesday is flea market, always something to do.",0
"Great customer service, clean bathroom and kitchen. Perfect pita",0
"We got a super greek, gyro, bacon build your own. All were so good. The staff was very nice. The gentleman that made them was great at it more than 5 stars",0
"This was my first time at a Pita Pit and I was not disappointed! I got the gyro on a wheat pita and it was so good. The veggies were all so fresh and it cost just as much (maybe even a little less) than all of the other fast food places around. The staff was upbeat and kind, we'll definitely be going again!",0
The sandwiches are HUGE!! My husband really enjoyed his and said he would be back.,0
"Not sure what changed recently, but the last pita I got stuck to the wrapper and I couldn't eat all of it. Had to throw out about a quarter of it because it just fell apart at the bottom.",0
You can never go wrong with getting lunch or dinner from Pita Pit in Soldotna. They load up the meals and its always enough for two meals for me. Good prices and amazing customer service.,0
The food here is SO good! I think it is a little over priced though. I tried their gluten free wrap a l d it actually wasn't bad at all. I would get it again! The service was excellent as well as the food!,0
This review is way past due. Pita Pit has been open just 9 months and already Iâ€™ve achieved VIP status on their app!! Iâ€™m always greeted with a hearty hello before the door closes as I walk in. Staff is friendly and even has my â€œregularâ€ order memorized. Itâ€™s good to throw them a curve every now and then. But they always handle it well. Great value for the price. It didnâ€™t take me long to figure out that double meat isnâ€™t required to fill me up. They always give you plenty!!,0
First time at this location. My sandwich artist was amazing and made me a delicious pita. Very clean and happy staff.,0
"We just had our first meal here. Friendly staff, clean environment, and my sandwich was amazing! Don't be afraid to ask for one of the owners special versions of the menu items. Wow good! Thanks!",0
"Mediocre food, wrong order taken and absolutely 0 covid precautions while in a tourist town ðŸ¤« Their was no social distancing behind the counter. I believe there were 4 people behind it, working very close together, two were shoulder to shoulder, without masks, no hand sanatizer seen either. Basically no cares given while they breath all over your food. Then mess up your order then attempt to fix it in the laziest most careless way. Why did she think I wanted a salad and why did they just dump the salad in a pita, turn down the music if it will help you receive orders",0
Got the Boom Boom and the Thai on wheat..... delicious,0
We absolutely love going top pita pit. Worth the drive from homer! Thanks for a wonderful lunch!,0
Love the pitas taste great. Favorite meal for 10 bucks.,0
"Was excited to give Pita Pit a try in Soldotna, very nice new building they have. Almost ten years ago now I would eat Pita Pit in Boise Idaho almost on the daily. When Anchorage got there first Pita Pit, I was excited to try it again, I fund it wasn't near the size, quality or value of the Boise location. It seemed like a lot of hype, as most new restaurants are in Anchorage. However, I would say the Soldotna location made a great sandwich much better than I can remember Anchorage doing, granted I went when they first opened and probably were still figuring things out and also with new employees. Really loved the Steak Fajita, tasted fresh and was filling! The only thing that get's me still hence the 4/5 review is the price. For a combo for two was over $30 bucks. Thats on the expensive side for two sandwiches. Thanks Pita Pit, they're making great sandwiches in Soldotna!",0
I won trivia. Contest. Got a Baja salad. & fruit smoothie. For free,0
Super friendly and fast,0
"Great service, nice clean atmosphere, good food lots of variety.",0

Your staff is awesome,0
Good and fresh food,0
It was amaz8ng,2
I like it here.,0
Pretty darn good,2
Great sandwich and service!!,0
"As always, Pita Pit didn't disappoint. A mouthful of flavors that completely satisfied our hunger.",0
Good place to put all the stuff you don't need.,0
"Great security, various size storage units, great prices. Only issue is that they lock the gate around 8pm so you can't get in. It's a problem if you need in at night or are moving and need to use it throughout the night.",0
Secure location for stoarge needs. Office is helpful and reasonable. Long time customer and will come back again next time I move back to homer,0
"Not a bad storage facility and nice folks, but when I moved my stuff in, I inquired about the gate whether thereâ€™s a code or hours. I was told itâ€™s always open. Good to know. Well, one night when I had to leave around midnight for a very early flight for some military stuff I was doing, I dropped by for some of my gear. Well guess whatâ€”gate was locked. There was a sign saying gate hours and sorry for the inconvenience. Let me tell you, I was pretty irate. Luckily I found a way in or I would have rammed the gate. Not one phone call or notice about the change in advance. Unacceptable for a business to not do due diligence to notify customers. If youâ€™re going to lock your gate after customers made the choice to do business with you because they get 24/7 access to their stuff, be big girls and boys, and install a coded gate system.",0
Staff was amazing despite having already locked the gate due to it being 20 minutes after they close they let my friend who's storage unit we were going to and me in the gate .. we were allowed 30 minutes to load up some of his stuff into his storage unit .. thank you much East End Mini Storage I could have had his stuff in my car all weekend LOL,0
Makes me feel better about my belongings being there with a locking gate.,0
"Great place to store your things, safe and professional",0
Nice staff! Very helpful!!,0
"Fare, clean..and friendly.",2
Great hike. Fairly steep from the from the turn off of turgagain arm trail. Intermittent sections of scree. Always be bear aware,0
Really nice hike! It got rough towards the top. But the view is incredible just like most hikes in Alaska!,0
"Trail is well packed for the first bit. Once the real climb starts itâ€™s icy and slick, didnâ€™t make it to the peak due to poor trail conditions this time of year. Highly recommend for the views.",0
Its has some really nice views. A little effort and during the summer you could enjoy a nice lunch with a view up here.,0
Great Mountain hike! Not for beginners. Challenging but fun! Very little snow today.,0
Nice trail. A lot of loose rocks. The view from the summit was so worth the effort!,0
Put your ice cleats and you can enjoy this trail year round!,0
"My favorite day hike on the Seward Hwy, way better than Bird Ridge in my opinion. But if you are not an experienced hiker I recommend you stay away from this trail. The scree field at the top can be dangerous if you've never experienced it before.",0
Waterfalls and spectacular views on a fairly simple and non strenuous trail...only downside is it's near the highway and can hear the cars from the trail almost the entire time,0
"Hidden gem of a trail. Not heavily trafficked, beautiful views, a creek, and blueberry picking galore! It has some steep sections and has some loose gravel in places so good hiking shoes are recommended.",0
Nice short hike for the whole family. Very pretty and gets you out of the heat with all of the heavy foliage.,0
Great hike - see all trails for more details,0
Fun hike. Be Bear Aware!,0
So beautiful! Bring your hikers some water and your best camera.,0

"Easy mountainside hike, very near Anchorage.",0
A beautiful hike!,2
Beaautiful place to hike,0
"Nice quiet hike. Trail is overgrown in places, but still easy to navigate. There are tons of raspberries and serviceberries all along the trail.",0
There are nice camping spots at the trail head and at the end of the trail. But space is very limited. Beatiful clean water,0
Good trail. My three year old made it about halfway.,0
"Great trail to walk, short but with a nice and interesting vegetation; if you have a tour guide, mostly they will tell you everything about it, and as well interesting to know that the famous film from star wars ""the return of the jedi"" was shooted in here, exactly the portion of the sky scooters, were the persecution took place, and where the ""Ewoks"" lived. Enjoy being in the set.",0
Gorgeous surroundings on a nice little trail through the woods next to Connell Lake. Pretty well maintained and I love how they adapted the trail around some trees that fell across the path.,0
"It was a magical night!! Full moon diving in and out of the clouds! Beautiful, beyond words!!",0
Nice day for a walk through the rain forest.,0
Beautiful place with a well kept trail. Fun for the family!,0

"Loved it had a blast but, a lot of ppl",0
Nice trails easy parking and a wonderful view,0
"A harbor bar, geared toward fishermen. You can find Coasties, hunters and tourists from time to time. No frills â€” though more than they used to, since they now take credit cards and have TVs.",0
Awesome place and bartender!! Def place to visit and play pool,0
Ive ben frequenting this establisment since 1984. Hasnt changed much. And thats its appeal.,0
Local dive bar. Pool table. Beer.,0
Good hangout place,2
Way better than the Mecca.,0
"Oldest bar in Kodiak, the only one that predate the 64 earthquake, it was the original breakers bar.",0
Cash only bar.,2
Cash only. Open till 4 if people are buying drinks. Locals/fisherman.,0
Best dive on the island,0

Absolutely fantastic dishes breakfast and lunch homemade daily and great service this is a must stop place if visiting Peterburg!,0
"This place is awesome, each time I go I try something new and different.",0
Cute place with good tea options and lots of baked goods,0
"OMG! This place is a gem, a hidden jewel in a little Alaska town. The view of the mountains, boat and harbor is stunning, but the food is to die for. I might just make another trip to Petersburg just so I can try more things from this artisan bakery. Thank you for putting a little of yourselves into every wonderful thing in your cases.",0
Great food and service,0
Quick bites but the stylish atmosphere makes you want to slow down and enjoy life & food.,0

This is the 2nd store I've called in Anchorage about their new wings which have been being talked about on social media and news outlets. Apparently they are not doing the new wings which are supposed to be 10 for 7.99. Update: called back and was told to contact the franchise owner Ian ianhurd@dominosalaska.com to figure what's going on. So if anyone has future issues with food quality or issues in general just send an email to that address is what I was told. Would like to see these new wings in Alaska stores soon.,1
"After being a twenty year client of this Vet, I was surprised to find out how unqualified they are!! In October 2019, I made an appointment to get our Yorkie in for an appointment because she could not use her limps and could barely stand up. The Vet made a diagnoses as GME and prescribed 10 mg cortisone tablets twice a day. Our little Yorkie responded in two days and we ween her off the medication. Fast forward 6 months and our little Yorkie had the same symptoms and could not walk or use her limbs. We tried to get an appointment at this Vet during this Covid-19 but to no avail; not a return phone call for over 36 hours for an emergency condition. We went to Pet ER here in Anchorage and they contact Tier 1 in Palmer which had an Orthopedic Surgeon available. In the fall of 2019, We were informed by Vets at Pet Stop we had no Orthopedic Surgeon/Doctors in Alaska; of course we believe them, they were our vet for 20 years. So, we took our little girl to the Palmer and an MRI was performed and the results were absolutely shocking; she had 4 ruptured disc in her neck!! We were devastated at this news. However, this was our little girl and the surgeon gave us high hopes for recovery if she had surgery. She required immediate surgery because she lost function of her limbs. So, this became a no-brainer and we hope for the best however, our little girl did not make it out of recovery; trying to repair two budging disc at one time seemed to be too much and she took her trip across the rainbow bridge. We could have had better results if this diagnoses was revealed in October 2019 instead of the GME diagnoses. What really hit home was the Vet stating there was no orthopedic doctors here in Alaska and it turned out there are at least three available. So, I would really use extreme caution when given a diagnoses that this Vet Clinic. Also, please check the qualifications of each veterinarian on staff to gain a comfort level and most of all, get a second opinion!!! We lost our little girl because we put all our faith in this Vet Clinic and it definitely was the wrong thing to do. In addition, we are moving out of Alaska and we had an appointment to get our pets vaccinate on March 26, 2020; they cancelled the appointment and told us to reschedule one week before we leave Alaska; we called today and now it is impossible to meet that schedule of one week. We have lost all faith in this Vet Clinic and I will be glad to put Alaska behind us because of all the smoke and mirrors that comes from these people.",0
Came in to buy a $1300 laptop and attempted to get help from several different sales associates.I waited 45 minutes for assistance and nobody helped. I guess I'm taking my money elsewhere.,0
Our national parks are the best thing the US government ever did.,0
Wonderful funky and casual little coffee spot. I like non-chain coffee shops a lot and this one did not disappoint. A great place to go and get some work done on the laptop while enjoying a delicious coffee beverage.,0
"Decent enough DMV. Parking is usually adequate, location is centeral. Employees try to move things efficiently, but this is a government organization so wait times are long. I recommend making an appointment online beforehand.",0
"I'm very torn in writing this review. Black Cup serves some of the best coffee in town, but I struggle to get past the shortcomings of the location itself. On my last several visits, the common areas have been exceptionally unclean. The floors appear to have not been swept or mopped in days, and my backpack has stains to prove it. I did not look closely at the food and coffee preparation areas, but hopefully they are better maintained. The ceiling was dripping water onto my table, barely missing my laptop. When I informed the staff, they replied that they were aware but had no plans to fix the leak. One of the two bathrooms had a broken toilet that would not flush, and unfortunately one or more previous occupants had found out too late in their visit... Until the proprietors make some much-needed repairs and institute better cleanliness standards, I do not plan to revisit Black Cup.",1
I went to a Great TRUMP EVENT!! Thanks for allowing us to use your facility,1
I like this place but could do without the polital signs at the greenhouse entry. Can't we even go shopping without politics?,0
"If you want a spicy chicken sandwich and a frosty chocolate shake then you need to stop by Wendy's before you drive home. This Wendy's is a great location for those of you that commute to the valley, but the 5th Ave traffic is horrible. At peak times (4-5 PM) the drive-thru is completely full, so park and go inside. While the spicy chicken sandwich only takes seconds to complete the frosty chocolate shake could be out-of-order or take a minute or two to finish. The dinning area is relaxing with a television to watch the news.",0
"When I was there they only had two beer options and neither of them were amazing. The good news is that they are always making new batches, so the next you go, it will be completely different. The atmosphere is like a coffee shop, except with beer. No food. Just a great place to hang out.",0
"If only the state of Alaska operated this park it would be so much better. Which federal Parks has Travelers we can never stay in a park because we can't know where we're going to be far enough ahead of time. Our federal government can never enlarge or provide adequate camping within a national park matter how many years they are given to do it. On a clear day it's a beautiful mountain and it can best be seen by either spending $65 in writing a six-hour bus or heading south of the park along the Parks Highway and doing it from the Alaska state park or the highway. These are both free. In the federal part of the park there's no parking no camping and no doing anything signs everywhere. If you love rules regulations limitations and manipulations you will love our federal parks. It is amazing how regulated The Great Outdoors can be when our federal government is helping us. If you go to the information Center, notice the part of the park that is owned by the state of Alaska. You can do everything in this part of the park hunt fish camp mostly for free. Alaska treats its citizens with respect and provide services. our federal government treats the franchise holders and vendors in the state parks with respects and does a setup that allows them to exploit the public more than serve the public If you're willing to tolerate the federal government's idea of freedom, there are great Trails great views and great hiking opportunities in Denali that are unbeatable. Some of the information in the visitor centers must be taken with a grain of salt as the Environmental extremist write the copy. On a cloudy day or bad weather the mountain is so high you will not be able to see it for me any viewpoints! It is amazing to see a natural resource so methodically exploited by the government and vendors while pretending to be a beacon of Nature and wholesomeness",0
In all honesty the tech at Wal-Mart knows more about the phones and devices in AT&T then the AT&T sales person. They can't give me any information I want. I know iPhones and Samsung's sell them selves but when I'm trying to compare phones for what's right for me it isn't an iPhone versus a galaxy. I want all my options. The staff is undertrained. They don't even know what the plans they have are. The staff blame it on AT&T always changing the deals. I believe you should be aware. I left and went to GCI and got a phone from them. Service was by far better.,0
"Overpriced items. It took almost 10 minutes to get any help and no one else was in the store. I think the manager was a little ... preoccupied. They did, however, help me recover lost data from a laptop.",0
A visit to the actual Alaskan Brewery in Juneau. Good news is you get to sample the beers. Bad news is there is no Brewery tour. Shame. It also sells a selection of merchandise. There is one IPA that is not available anywhere else so worth a trip to sample that.,0
"We dined at this new restaurant because of a review I read in the Anchorage Daily News (by Mara Severin, Dec 28, 2018), which was glowing on the verge of ecstasy. And our experience was much the same. Whether you are an avid foodie (Tres Amigos Tacos) or looking for a comfortable, filling meal (Kimchi Tots), you won't be disappointed. The selections are a truly serendipitous find in a town where almost every restaurant hypes the same old bland, boring menu--as if! The combinations of taste were new and delightful; but most importantly, everything we ate was cooked perfectly and served hot out of the kitchen. I was reminded of my all-time favorite restaurant, Asia de Cuba. And while, of course, the menu and presentation at Seoul Casa is very different, it now rates #2 on my list for originality and aptitude. (For another surprise, ask where the chef learned to cook.) You add your own heat, so great for kids and wimps like me. Great for date night because the food itself is a conversation piece. Friendly wait staff who appreciate both the foodie and the simply hungry. Prices are very reasonable considering how much you get. Don't be put off by the spare and somewhat confusing dining room when you step inside. Just sit right down and prepare to be delighted.",0

"We love this place compared to other Yogurt Lounges. They have so many toppings to choose from and the fruit looks and tastes so fresh. Also, they have classic flavors and some fun news ones to try so everyone can get something they like. The atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable for dates, small or big groups, and they even have kids toys!",0
"This is a god-awful, Russia-slum eyesore that should have been demolished by the government decades ago, and used as a wave barrier and fishing pier. It was a wonderful facility 55 years ago, but now it's a filthy, moldy, glass-free shell. I imagine the cost of demolition and haul-off is most likely prohibitive, so it will remain a brooding blight over Whittier AK for centuries to come.",0
This place is strange for shelter everything echoes and certain staff are very mean and not very good food and people demoralizing you by watching you shower while on there phone no public restroom and people coughing all the time and only Polly John Trump wall . Not enough blankets or clothes.,0
"Their espresso is unbearable, and they purposefully have removed the electrical sockets so people can't get work done with a laptop. They also have a 1 hour max use of internet, and it is hell expensive... really dislike the place",0
"Great staff, amazing selection. Usually have a election to rival the warehouse",0
"Place to call home after quakes. Fri-Sun 7:30a-9-30a Early bird Breakfast $9.99, Dinner $ 16.99. M-Th Brunch 9:30a-2p $10.29, Dinner $16.99. Any news if they will put one in Wasilla? ..Would probably make a load a $$$.",0
Bought an otterbox for my Samsung galaxy 20 ultra. They guy was kind enough to put my screen protector on free of charge and you need to have an account which i didn't have. SUPER FRIENDLY STAFF! thanks!!!! (:,0
"Quiet, plenty of places to plug in a laptop or charge your phone.",0
"Sent in a laptop to be repaired, arrieved with scratches, smudges and was found unrepairable.",0
"Bleh. They're literally there to only sell you new phones and accessories. If you need help troubleshooting don't bother, they aren't trained. You're better off using YouTube as your source of helpas the staff informed me they are only trained by watching videos, nothing more. And they're really only trained to use an iPhone and nothing else. So if you need help with your pixel or your Android you better find someone else to help you.",0
"They always have the cheapest cell phone prices, and I do my price researching pretty intensely. They also have the best sales associates! They are always knowledgable and very helpful. HOWEVER.....!! Their delivery is horrible at the Dimond store! I preordered my new Samsung Note 10+ and they kept emailing me to say my order would come in a few more weeks instead. It took so long to come in that I ended up cancelling my order, driving across town to the other store, and actually BOUGHT ONE OFF THE SHELF. The only plus in that deal was that I saved 60% of the phone's price.",0
Thank God for theses people and our American government,0
"This is a great place to shop for all your needs, and not have to worry about price, politics, and principles. The deli is the best in town, and their seafood is always fresh.",0
"Easy access over anchorage. This store is very cute clean and modern. If you need to do something on a laptop, they have tables and outlets to do your work on. I would recommend the Ultra-Caramel Frappachino, and defenitely the White Chocolate Mocha! Those two are my favorite. I have yet to try the Caramel Cloud Macchiato. The classic coffee cake is my favorite pastry. If you are going here for the first time i would recommend any of the things i have listed.",0
"As a tourist spot, the 5th Avenue Mall is full to the brim with everything we need at immediate gadgets we can buy such as Cell Phones, Video Game Consoles, laptop computers and cloths. Come see it for yourself. And the 5th floor is reserved for food. Come get you some.",0
"Multiple phone calls and multiple applications to get internet from the one utility available. Typical. The customer service people deserve credit for their patience in having to tell you the next bad news about filling out a new form, you can only do this online, and not having any information from the company to share with you. I have been stuck with 4 mbps for years with twice a year calls to be told - you canâ€™t get it. BTW - if you were new construction, you could not get service.",0
"Camp hosts were awesome, very friendly and informative. Even had the latest fishing news. The camp itself is nice (No hook-ups), being this is the headquarters site for this region's state camping it is the largest, only disappointment is the bulk dumpster (NO RECYCLE).",0
"For a government agency, very helpful to a friend of mine in need. Big hearts here",0
"In the past, I've received excellent customer service. In this case however the reception person was completely rude, did not listen, was dismissive and interrupted each sentence that the person I was with and myself attempted to make. She was a horrible reception person and really shouldn't be in that position... With her General attitude and demeanor, I'm not sure she should be in any professional position without extensive customer service training. Learning the art of listening would be greatly beneficial to her and anyone - and I mean anyone professionally or personally - who has the opportunity to talk with her. Her name was Kayla. I found her services to be far below stellar and her attitude completely inappropriate rude and dismissive I tried to explain a very simple concept which she interrupted and said this is totally different and I had not yet even finished what I was about to say and when I try to say something further the person I was with said she's not listening to you. She interrupted the person I was with him said oh I am listening I just had to do this this in this. Unbelievably rude, unbelievably opinionated and arrogant. I've never had such a bad experience at GCI in my life. Normally their employees are incredibly competent both in person and over the telephone. This Kayla should not be working at the front desk or in any position without extreme and extensive customer service training. Learning the art of shutting her mouth when somebody else is speaking, especially a customer, would greatly benefit her. It would greatly benefit anyone around here. As I said earlier, this was a very negative experience and Kayla was the cause of it. What we were asking about she made sound impossible which was far from impossible. She also used the term iOS in a way to make yourself look smarter and confuse the person I was with. I had to actually say to the other person she's talking about an iPhone. I got the impression she like to Bandy a term about to make yourself seem smarter than she was and to confuse the general customer. The person I was with an I left completely dissatisfied and rather upset by her supposed customer service skills. She realized just how badly she had behaved and tried to backpedal and be a little bit more friendly when she realized that we would probably report her to a supervisor. It was painfully obvious, transparent and really quite the satisfying.",0
A government agency. What more really needs to be said? Wait 6 hours in queue for heating assistance for a chance to talk to someone to get some diesel oil instead of burning cheap firewood because someone threatens you with fines for doing that. plan for visits here to take all day.,0
"I love the rooms, great complimentary breakfast!! Please turn off FOX NEWS though...Nauseating rhetoric in the morning!!",0
"DO NOT ORDER ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!! Second time happened that after ordering pizza online through their site, a few days later someone from ALBANIA tried to run our card (to buy something from Globe.com.al Albanian site) first for $1000, and second time for $200!!! Good thing our bank blocked these charges!!! Its a total scam and they save card numbers and run them later! If you want their pizza, order over the phone and ask for the %20 online discount, but dont trust their site!!",0
"Kind, friendly service -- yes, from the government even! We walked the longer 2 mile path. Fairly easy walk if you are use to the distance. Kids will love the visitor center. Not sure I would take my kiddos on the longer path as I wouldn't want to intentionally run into a bear with them. Although one of them is slower than the others and talks back the most....",0

Great place for outdoor activities. Unfortunately hiking trail entrance is not dog poof-proof. Hiking trails are quite a bit windproof! Going to Blueberry Knoll and climbing Government peak in the winter lots of fun with refreshing all the safety skills. I go there few times in a week!,0
"Two good restaurants and a breakfast cafe, several gift stores, an activewear store, and a chocolate store with amazing chocolate delights. This hotel is used by locals and government regularly. And, all the famous people stay here.",0
"Food was amazing, the service was great. The only things keeping me from rating 5 stars is that I'm not a fan of eating with dead animals on the walls and Fox News on the TV. Ymmv",0
"The locals call this place ""the hallway"" because that's literally all there is. The good news is that there is a Michaels in town. The bad news is that Michaels and Safeway are the anchor stores. Otherwise, you have icing and like American Eagle to shop, which is convenient when you are talking 6 hours to the next closest mall. No food court. It's not really a mall by Lower 48 standards, but it does the job. They always do a Halloween thing for the kids, which is fun since it's freezing cold outside every October 31.",0
"The location is horrific. Many of their patients are elderly, disabled, or just don't see well (DUH). It is a nightmare to get to, a nightmare to park (their lot is completely inadequate), and staff is often rude or just plain nasty. My husband only goes here because he is trapped in the VA system and this practice is the one they refer to, probably because they have an ex-military doctor here that knows the government ropes. This practice has been here since 1972 when downtown was still an OK destination and gentrification began. Wake up people, this location means dealing with street people, and the jail is just down the street. It is at the foot of a MONSTROUS hill that is impossible to drive up in the winter, and to avoid it you have to go to the worst area in Anchorage, by the homeless shelter and Bean's Cafe. Time for them to move to midtown for their clientele. Just plain UNSAFE to go here.",0
"lame as hell!! no actual information about alaska in my opinion and i live here. theirs a empty prebuilt cabin inside, a representation of the northern light(kinda), a tundra scene that should have been updated 20 years ago(they have oil money and grants so theirs no excuse not to) and a gift shop with ""authentic"" native gift....for 40 dollars lol, some pictures of the northern light for sale for 97.00 that arent any better than the one i took with my iphone! its a place to scam tourists out of there time and money and make them think this is the alaska experience. the most culture there is a bush plane hanging from the celing...no thanks and thanks for the boring afternoon",0
The south viewpoint is far better than the north - it gives your sweeping views up the river which creates dramatic depth when shooting photos of the mountain. The grounds seem to be better maintained also with plenty of information and binoculars to observe the surrounds. Make sure you have a good zoom on your camera because youâ€™re still a bit too far for your iPhone camera to be effective,0
"This was a great surprise. McGivney's had a clean/classy interior with comfortable seating, lots of TVs with sports and news (but not too loud), friendly staff, quick service, and good food. I got a burger and my friend had a gyro and we had wings and some kind of pork pieces for appetizers. I'd be a regular if I still lived in ""the big city"".",0

"Service was great! Went in to purchase a new hands gun (.45) process was simple and concise. Instead of filling out forms in paper, everything is digital and completed on a tablet. This minimizes questionable handwriting and mistakes in getting clearance for the sale. I'd highly recommend the firearms service counter and the gentleman that helped me out. Just remember: bring your government issued ID with your physical and a government form, of some sort, that has your physical address if your ID only has a PO Box.",0
"1st time home owner, never had my chimney cleaned or inspected. I called and got my appointment setup for a week out, cleaners came out, inspected and cleaned. They quoted me a higher price initially but reduced it because my chimney wasn't really dirty! The crew that came out was great, professional, and informative about the process. They even gave me extra advice on the house we were looking to buy. Overall a great service by a great local company. If I was to ever have bad news with a chimney, I'd want these folks to give it to me - they are honest and strive to do the right thing.",0

"Tried to pawn my 1400 dollar laptop, I only wanted 200 for it and when she said ""we will try to get you close to that"" I laughed like ok. I set the price pretty low thinking it was a easy process, but no. She looked at me and says I'll give you 75.... I felt disrespected. So I went to the next pawn shop in Wasilla and to no surprise I got 200 for it like I asked.",0
"Iâ€™ve had a lot, A LOT of pizza in my life. This by far blows it all out of the water. Best pizza ever! They have options for everyone. If youâ€™re feeling spicy, my favorite is the Spicy Pizza (pepperoni sausage and jalapeÃ±os). They also have plenty of non-spicy options. Their crust is AMAZING! And better news folks, THEY SELL THEIR DOUGH! Great way to make some pizzas with the kiddos! Highly recommend.",0

"MC Hough is a great get-away from Anchorage- beautiful and wild. I often brought my son Aidan here when he was little. It was our favorite place to go nearest the City. However, over the years from so much use and abuse, there has been a lot of damage to the trees and other vegetation. ""Compaction"" as State Parks calls it, from so many happy feet visiting virtual wilderness, compacts the soil around the roots of trees which exposes their roots. Then the trees die and blow over in the wind. Then more trees are exposed and blow down. This is a cascading effect. Then forest fires rage through as natures way of clearing the debris and restoring the forest. Mc Hough Creek is A GREAT place to begin UNPRECEDENTED collaboration between Alaska State Parks, Chugach National Forest and those who know and love Mc Hough Creek and Forest. This collaboration is a way for people and government to work together for virtual benefit. Otherwise, Mc Hough Creek may continue to become more and more degraded.",0
"Tech teams are all super helpful. From best buy techs to geek squad they are all very helpful. Questions about phone switch, laptop trade in, and general questions on audio all researched and answered quickly. The tech let me open a package to see if product fit my phone. Great, friendly team here in anchorage!",0
"Need food while on campus? Or looking to find a place to people watch, play games or meet new friends? This is a good place to start. You can also find the student government office and lots of community programs.",0
Truly impressive facility. Great location. They were setting up a large Magic tournament in the back while we were there. They had an X-men comic my son had been seeking at a very good price. Knowledgeable staff and an amazing collection. Now Iâ€™ve got their bumper sticker on my laptop. So glad our Anchorage friends recommended it. Worth the trip to Alaska!,0
"After several tests I learned that my vision is 20/20 and my eyes are doing well. At my age I expected to hear my vision wasn't as sharp, but the doctor said I'm doing well. If you're visiting the Ophthalmic Associates I hope you have positive news too, however I'm confident that you're in the right place no matter the situation. Parking is a little strange here, but there is a parking lot next door and it's free. Make sure the parking sign says, ""Ophthalmic Associates"" or you're in the wrong parking lot. There are stairs, many stairs, so expect a mild workout to visit the waiting rooms and restrooms. Cell phone coverage was fine downstairs, but the Internet connection will be much slower.

Always great and easy to catch a flight. Love the new decorations and wildlife exhibits. Only 3 stars because every TV is turned to fake news provided by GCI... I guess I'm switching to ACS.,0
Employees are super nice and they have a good selection of Jewelry. Gave me a good price for my laptop.,0

They decided they wanted to mix politics and food on an official Facebook page so gotta take back four of my stars.,0
Friendly staff and great service all around! I live my truck and they help me take good care of it. One thing I would change would be the constant political news in the waiting room. Thankfully they have a TV free place by the coffee many of us chose to sit at instead.,0
Went there for an issue with my 3 month old Samsung Galaxy S9+ it won't do a software update at all. So I spoke with Raymond who informed me we are in Alaska and I would have to call AT&T. This guy is a complete idiot and should not be working in customer service or in any technology company.,0
The south viewpoint is far better than the north - it gives your sweeping views up the river which creates dramatic depth when shooting photos of the mountain. The grounds seem to be better maintained also with plenty of information and binoculars to observe the surrounds. Make sure you have a good zoom on your camera because youâ€™re still a bit too far for your iPhone camera to be effective,0

"It's a real old-fashioned barbershop, with 4 chairs and 4 barbers on the busy days. For the price of a cut at a barber college you get an experienced barber to cut your hair. Conversation is usually pretty good, ranging from duck recipes to oil prices and the local news, and old days stories about the Alyeska Pipeline getting put in. Hours vary - however, if they have enough people to last till quittin' time, they lock the doors. No ""Last Minute Larry's"" here!",0
"On the way to Denali we stopped at the Alaskan Veterans Memorial, the setting was spectacular and inviting. You can wander about soaking up the scenery while walking the loop and visit the Memorial itself. It is a well put together site, honoring the Alaskan men and women in the service in the US Armed Forces. Great stop and kudos to the State Government for the site. Enjoy.",0
"I wish I had not gone to this store... it can only accommodate 1 person at a time.. Each employee that works there says they are the manager... Anyways had I known that they were not an Official Verizon Store I would have looked elsewhere... They cannot even add your Military Discount to your account, I had to go to the Official Verizon Store in the Diamond Center and they took care of me in about a minute... uploaded my ID Card to my Account ... Also John at the Diamond Store of Go WIRELESS had me pay off my Note 9 512 GB so I could get my other one free and told me that the one I paid off could leave their network on 10/6/2018 .. Now I have the District Manager saying that he cannot allow that and John ,he would have to verify, and Lindsey they fired for stealing according to the gal that worked last week at the Tudor Store ... she also said she was the manager and would send the District Manager a message to contact me... I guess he never got it or he did not care.. when I spoke with him this afternoon he said he had spoken with me many times and I had said that this was the 2nd time... I did the BOGO Pre-order of 2 note 9 512gb 1 blue and 1 Purple which got screwed up I kept getting promised that my phone was being FedEx by Lindsy and her District Manager John told me to buy out the Purple Note 9 512 GB and would get the other one free plus the Purple one can leave the system on 10/6/2018.. I checked my Verizon account and found that someone had removed the credit from my account that is wht prompted me to check before I transferred my wife's phone to other carrier.. Lindsey gave me a note 9 128 GB Purple as a loaner till mine was to arrive in the 2 days which never happened.. phone never arrived... Samsung Duo Charger never received... when I spoke to the District Manager, he was well aware of what needed to be done... Still waiting for 1249.00 credit on my account Big waste of time with this business... Oh.. I ordered a Samsung Duo Charger from Ebay for 80 bucks ... never opened their single Charger.. why would I want a single one when I have 2 phones...",0
"I had to get a replacement SIM, but had to return as it wouldn't work properly once I left the store. I would recommend customers who are looking to purchase a mobile to do your own research, to be a knowledgeable consume and buy a GSM factory unlocked phone that would work with AT&T, T-mobile from Amazon or eBay. For an Apple iphone, SE 128GB for the best value or 8 256GB for better value, not the latest nor bleeding edge technology. For Android, look for one with Android One, free of bloatware, i.e. Motorola Moto X4 64GB 4GB RAM, it's an older model now but supports the frequencies used by AT&T. Buying a mobile from AT&T would generally be a locked phone, meaning it would only work on their network unless you request that it be unlocked after you have service with them for one year. Unlocked phones allow you to use any GSM network. Using AT&T is more expensive, it is also the largest coverage network, usually competent service. Inquire about the prepaid plans online. One of their plans offers 8GB of data each month provided you prepaid up front for 12 months.",0

The lesbian woman in the Hydration station gave me a nasty look when I came out of the restroom and seemed to have been conversing with her co worker about me.

"The Seoul Casa is a unique restaurant. You'll find Tex-Mex with a Korean taste. Kim-chi is found in many of the menu items which is interesting, but if I had to say the best tasting ingredient it would be the meat. The chicken and beef are very flavorful. The seasoning is mostly spicy and I have good news, the food is extra spicy the next day should you have leftovers. The employees are very polite and they do a great job of suggesting entrees. The 3 Amigos Tacos is one of their most popular entrees. The Supreme Kim-chi Tots is a massive plate and the sauce is very spicy, so make sure you share!

"As a store - customer service is moderately helpful... But while many common electronics can be found here, cheaper AND better stuff is all over Amazon. For example- if you are spending over $40 on an HDMI your wallet is getting completely trainwrecked. Search Amazon for ""Bluerigger HDMI"" instead... Another common problem is people coming in to get a laptop when they are very unfamiliar with the topic... Again Newegg and Amazon are the best here, try Lenovo Dell or Asus for midline quality, and MSI, Sager or expensive ASUS options for gaming/high performance.

"The locals call this place ""the hallway"" because that's literally all there is. The good news is that there is a Michaels in town. The bad news is that Michaels and Safeway are the anchor stores. Otherwise, you have icing and like American Eagle to shop, which is convenient when you are talking 6 hours to the next closest mall. No food court.

"The library is great. Simple setting with different sections; childrens area, movies, newspapers and magazines, book series, computers to use, a study area, shelves are alphabetically and numerically organized making finding what you need more convenient. The barista in the hall is also really good, has a selection of hot beverages to choose from, I personally like the vanilla chai. They hold several different events and meetings in the theater area; movies every now and then, coucil meetings, dog shows, high school proms and balls, the saturday market. The museum is a bit basic with cultural heritage and items used by recent ancestors. It could use a few more things in there like native plants found around the area. The gift shop is a neat little area, my mom used to work there when I was young, been a while since I've taken a look in there. I do love the free books shelf when you first walk into the cultural center, along with the bulletin board of news and ads. Great place.",0
"Great place for an indoor hike. Sprawling superstore full of cheap goods mostly made in China. Owned by an American oligarchy family that refuses to pay its employees a living wage, forcing many to rely on Government assistance to survive. Routinely critized for stomping out locally owned and run businesses. Has also become a source of ridicule on the Internet regarding its low brow customer base and fashion style. They have what you may want but at what cost to a sense of community? Some people prefer to shop locally and to support their neighbors. Et tu, Brute?",0

"In the past, I've received excellent customer service. In this case however the reception person was completely rude, did not listen, was dismissive and interrupted each sentence that the person I was with and myself attempted to make. She was a horrible reception person and really shouldn't be in that position... With her General attitude and demeanor, I'm not sure she should be in any professional position without extensive customer service training. Learning the art of listening would be greatly beneficial to her and anyone - and I mean anyone professionally or personally - who has the opportunity to talk with her. Her name was Kayla. I found her services to be far below stellar and her attitude completely inappropriate rude and dismissive I tried to explain a very simple concept which she interrupted and said this is totally different and I had not yet even finished what I was about to say and when I try to say something further the person I was with said she's not listening to you. She interrupted the person I was with him said oh I am listening I just had to do this this in this. Unbelievably rude, unbelievably opinionated and arrogant. I've never had such a bad experience at GCI in my life. Normally their employees are incredibly competent both in person and over the telephone. This Kayla should not be working at the front desk or in any position without extreme and extensive customer service training. Learning the art of shutting her mouth when somebody else is speaking, especially a customer, would greatly benefit her. It would greatly benefit anyone around here. As I said earlier, this was a very negative experience and Kayla was the cause of it. What we were asking about she made sound impossible which was far from impossible. She also used the term iOS in a way to make yourself look smarter and confuse the person I was with. I had to actually say to the other person she's talking about an iPhone. I got the impression she like to Bandy a term about to make yourself seem smarter than she was and to confuse the general customer. The person I was with an I left completely dissatisfied and rather upset by her supposed customer service skills. She realized just how badly she had behaved and tried to backpedal and be a little bit more friendly when she realized that we would probably report her to a supervisor. It was painfully obvious, transparent and really quite the satisfying.",0

It wouldn't take it because the cashier couldn't figure out where to put the @ in an email that is @gmail.com. anyway where else ya gonna go?,0

"Had the Nachos with the Steak as a meat, very chewy and not that great. The cheese tasted like government cheese and phony. The Boss Burger wasnâ€™t that great either actually, just was super greasy and piled with low grade meats. The waitress was really kind though so I left her a tip. Will not return there again.",0

"In the past, I've received excellent customer service. In this case however the reception person was completely rude, did not listen, was dismissive and interrupted each sentence that the person I was with and myself attempted to make. She was a horrible reception person and really shouldn't be in that position... With her General attitude and demeanor, I'm not sure she should be in any professional position without extensive customer service training. Learning the art of listening would be greatly beneficial to her and anyone - and I mean anyone professionally or personally - who has the opportunity to talk with her. Her name was Kayla. I found her services to be far below stellar and her attitude completely inappropriate rude and dismissive I tried to explain a very simple concept which she interrupted and said this is totally different and I had not yet even finished what I was about to say and when I try to say something further the person I was with said she's not listening to you. She interrupted the person I was with him said oh I am listening I just had to do this this in this. Unbelievably rude, unbelievably opinionated and arrogant. I've never had such a bad experience at GCI in my life. Normally their employees are incredibly competent both in person and over the telephone. This Kayla should not be working at the front desk or in any position without extreme and extensive customer service training. Learning the art of shutting her mouth when somebody else is speaking, especially a customer, would greatly benefit her. It would greatly benefit anyone around here. As I said earlier, this was a very negative experience and Kayla was the cause of it. What we were asking about she made sound impossible which was far from impossible. She also used the term iOS in a way to make yourself look smarter and confuse the person I was with. I had to actually say to the other person she's talking about an iPhone. I got the impression she like to Bandy a term about to make yourself seem smarter than she was and to confuse the general customer. The person I was with an I left completely dissatisfied and rather upset by her supposed customer service skills. She realized just how badly she had behaved and tried to backpedal and be a little bit more friendly when she realized that we would probably report her to a supervisor. It was painfully obvious, transparent and really quite the satisfying.",0
Great spot to work on your laptop and catch the views of the Chugach Mountains.,0
Great place for outdoor activities. Unfortunately hiking trail entrance is not dog poof-proof. Hiking trails are quite a bit windproof! Going to Blueberry Knoll and climbing Government peak in the winter lots of fun with refreshing all the safety skills. I go there few times in a week!,0
"Absolutely awesome service. I needed title work done and the process was a little longer than at the DMV because they had to get the state's approval for lost title etc.. Their service includes the agent there filling out forms for you and all I needed to do was sign and date. Of course they charge a fee for their service, more than the dmv, but it's completely worth it. The wait time was no longer than 15 minutes. I got my title printed right there half hour later and after paying, was on my jolly way. The staff are all very helpful and I never once felt a reason to bring out ""the Karen"". These wonderful people will take any form of payment (card/cash). No bitcoin yet! Slow down! Anyway, would I go here again? Absolutely! Would I recommend others to go here? Definitely! Would I give them a great review? In a heartbeat! I'm pretty level headed about reviews and only give more than four stars if I can't think of any way for a business to improve.",0
"The Seoul Casa is a unique restaurant. You'll find Tex-Mex with a Korean taste. Kim-chi is found in many of the menu items which is interesting, but if I had to say the best tasting ingredient it would be the meat. The chicken and beef are very flavorful. The seasoning is mostly spicy and I have good news, the food is extra spicy the next day should you have leftovers. The employees are very polite and they do a great job of suggesting entrees. The 3 Amigos Tacos is one of their most popular entrees. The Supreme Kim-chi Tots is a massive plate and the sauce is very spicy, so make sure you share!

"DO NOT ORDER ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!! Second time happened that after ordering pizza online through their site, a few days later someone from ALBANIA tried to run our card (to buy something from Globe.com.al Albanian site) first for $1000, and second time for $200!!! Good thing our bank blocked these charges!!! Its a total scam and they save card numbers and run them later! If you want their pizza, order over the phone and ask for the %20 online discount, but dont trust their site!!",0

"Great place for an indoor hike. Sprawling superstore full of cheap goods mostly made in China. Owned by an American oligarchy family that refuses to pay its employees a living wage, forcing many to rely on Government assistance to survive. Routinely critized for stomping out locally owned and run businesses. Has also become a source of ridicule on the Internet regarding its low brow customer base and fashion style. They have what you may want but at what cost to a sense of community? Some people prefer to shop locally and to support their neighbors. Et tu, Brute?",0

"We dined at this new restaurant because of a review I read in the Anchorage Daily News (by Mara Severin, Dec 28, 2018), which was glowing on the verge of ecstasy. And our experience was much the same. Whether you are an avid foodie (Tres Amigos Tacos) or looking for a comfortable, filling meal (Kimchi Tots), you won't be disappointed. The selections are a truly serendipitous find in a town where almost every restaurant hypes the same old bland, boring menu--as if! The combinations of taste were new and delightful; but most importantly, everything we ate was cooked perfectly and served hot out of the kitchen. I was reminded of my all-time favorite restaurant, Asia de Cuba. And while, of course, the menu and presentation at Seoul Casa is very different, it now rates #2 on my list for originality and aptitude. (For another surprise, ask where the chef learned to cook.) You add your own heat, so great for kids and wimps like me. Great for date night because the food itself is a conversation piece. Friendly wait staff who appreciate both the foodie and the simply hungry. Prices are very reasonable considering how much you get. Don't be put off by the spare and somewhat confusing dining room when you step inside. Just sit right down and prepare to be delighted.",0
"I wish I had not gone to this store... it can only accommodate 1 person at a time.. Each employee that works there says they are the manager... Anyways had I known that they were not an Official Verizon Store I would have looked elsewhere... They cannot even add your Military Discount to your account, I had to go to the Official Verizon Store in the Diamond Center and they took care of me in about a minute... uploaded my ID Card to my Account ... Also John at the Diamond Store of Go WIRELESS had me pay off my Note 9 512 GB so I could get my other one free and told me that the one I paid off could leave their network on 10/6/2018 .. Now I have the District Manager saying that he cannot allow that and John ,he would have to verify, and Lindsey they fired for stealing according to the gal that worked last week at the Tudor Store ... she also said she was the manager and would send the District Manager a message to contact me... I guess he never got it or he did not care.. when I spoke with him this afternoon he said he had spoken with me many times and I had said that this was the 2nd time... I did the BOGO Pre-order of 2 note 9 512gb 1 blue and 1 Purple which got screwed up I kept getting promised that my phone was being FedEx by Lindsy and her District Manager John told me to buy out the Purple Note 9 512 GB and would get the other one free plus the Purple one can leave the system on 10/6/2018.. I checked my Verizon account and found that someone had removed the credit from my account that is wht prompted me to check before I transferred my wife's phone to other carrier.. Lindsey gave me a note 9 128 GB Purple as a loaner till mine was to arrive in the 2 days which never happened.. phone never arrived... Samsung Duo Charger never received... when I spoke to the District Manager, he was well aware of what needed to be done... Still waiting for 1249.00 credit on my account Big waste of time with this business... Oh.. I ordered a Samsung Duo Charger from Ebay for 80 bucks ... never opened their single Charger.. why would I want a single one when I have 2 phones...",0
"Unfortunately, Denali Park is expensive to visit. You can see the first 15 miles for free; however, there isn't much to see in that area. But to see the real sights along the rest of the 80 mile road you have to buy a bus ticket which range from $50 to over $100. The good news is that kids age 15 and under are free. Plan ahead because visiting the park is an all-day affair. Bring your own food and water on the bus. There are no snack shops in the park. Latrines are at most rest stops. The buses leave early in the morning and are gone for 8 to 12 hours. Get reserve seats because the buses sell out. Then prepare to be amazed at the vastness of Denali's grandure and open spaces. Keep your eyes peeled for the wildlife which are in river valleys, in the sky and behind a tree. If luck is with you, the clouds will clear and you will have a view of spectacular Mount Denali from several regions of the park. If you do get a clear view, snap a photo right then because the clouds can close back in within minutes and stay the rest of the day. There are too many breath-taking vistas to count. Geology buffs will love the diverse formations laid bare to the eyes for all to marvel. I would give it more stars if the costs were lower and the park had flushing toilets in more places.",0
"MC Hough is a great get-away from Anchorage- beautiful and wild. I often brought my son Aidan here when he was little. It was our favorite place to go nearest the City. However, over the years from so much use and abuse, there has been a lot of damage to the trees and other vegetation. ""Compaction"" as State Parks calls it, from so many happy feet visiting virtual wilderness, compacts the soil around the roots of trees which exposes their roots. Then the trees die and blow over in the wind. Then more trees are exposed and blow down. This is a cascading effect. Then forest fires rage through as natures way of clearing the debris and restoring the forest. Mc Hough Creek is A GREAT place to begin UNPRECEDENTED collaboration between Alaska State Parks, Chugach National Forest and those who know and love Mc Hough Creek and Forest. This collaboration is a way for people and government to work together for virtual benefit. Otherwise, Mc Hough Creek may continue to become more and more degraded.",0

"I'm very torn in writing this review. Black Cup serves some of the best coffee in town, but I struggle to get past the shortcomings of the location itself. On my last several visits, the common areas have been exceptionally unclean. The floors appear to have not been swept or mopped in days, and my backpack has stains to prove it. I did not look closely at the food and coffee preparation areas, but hopefully they are better maintained. The ceiling was dripping water onto my table, barely missing my laptop. When I informed the staff, they replied that they were aware but had no plans to fix the leak. One of the two bathrooms had a broken toilet that would not flush, and unfortunately one or more previous occupants had found out too late in their visit... Until the proprietors make some much-needed repairs and institute better cleanliness standards, I do not plan to revisit Black Cup.",0
"This is a god-awful, Russia-slum eyesore that should have been demolished by the government decades ago, and used as a wave barrier and fishing pier. It was a wonderful facility 55 years ago, but now it's a filthy, moldy, glass-free shell. I imagine the cost of demolition and haul-off is most likely prohibitive, so it will remain a brooding blight over Whittier AK for centuries to come.",0

"The military commissaries are, in general, awful. They are overcrowded, the hours are too short, the prices aren't any better (and often are higher), staff are usually rude and unhelpful, and the produce is the worst you'll find anywhere.

That said, I gave the JBER commissary 3 stars because it's the least awful one I've been to.",0

"I am not giving Golden Corral any Stars. The Bathrooms are really $---ty. They need to fix the bathrooms. Both mens and womens. The Food isn't that great. Because it is the Discards of CARRS/Safeway and Fred Meyers. They need fresh food. That means the food needs to be crisp and not old and stale. Other Buffets in town have it down. I repeat they have it down. Freshness is King. The Floor of the Golden Corral have not be professionally cleaned since they opened in the 1990's. Gosh i love that old stale smell of people and food on the floor. I bet the bugs love the stale smell too. The Brand Golden Corral does not care like the other buffets in town so the management just pays it workers CHEAP and reaps the profits and lets the place go. There was another building, another buffet in town near Alaska Dispatch News. They are rebuilding the facility from head to to...should be a great family resturant. Anyway...I never take anyone in my family here. I yell and cuss and scream at my coworkers if they are interested. Never eat here at this one in Alaska. Note: I have been to Golden Corrals in Washington, Oregon, other places. They actually are ok. Just NEVER the one in ALASKA! you are going to waste your money.",0
"Switched from StraightTalk to Cricket yesterday, keeping my number. It was very easy and quick. The only hang up was ST making the Cricket rep wait on hold for a ridiculous amount of time. ST doesn't actually support hotspot in Alaska. However, Cricket DOES support hotspot in Alaska! Which is extremely helpful during the semester if I ever need to be mobile with my laptop. I walked out of Cricket with 10GB of hotspot and a brand new Stylo 6. I paid less yesterday than I did a year ago when I signed up with ST purchasing a Stylo 5 and no hotspot.",0

"The library is great. Simple setting with different sections; childrens area, movies, newspapers and magazines, book series, computers to use, a study area, shelves are alphabetically and numerically organized making finding what you need more convenient. The barista in the hall is also really good, has a selection of hot beverages to choose from, I personally like the vanilla chai. They hold several different events and meetings in the theater area; movies every now and then, coucil meetings, dog shows, high school proms and balls, the saturday market. The museum is a bit basic with cultural heritage and items used by recent ancestors. It could use a few more things in there like native plants found around the area. The gift shop is a neat little area, my mom used to work there when I was young, been a while since I've taken a look in there. I do love the free books shelf when you first walk into the cultural center, along with the bulletin board of news and ads. Great place.",0
How hard could it possibly be to put the correct mail into the correct mailbox? They put my mail into someone's box who is out of town so I won't be able to get to it for months. Call to get it fixed and put me on hold for over an hour. Just another example of how useless government services are and why they should never be trusted to do anything.,0

And I have lived all over the world and this is normal. Golden Valley does a great job and deposits for power start up is normal as well, especially if your a person who doesn't pay their bill.

"ALASKA Christians: STOP BURYING YOUR TALENTS Dear Christian, Proposition 1 has failed. It failed because the enemies of God were more motivated to its defeat than the children of God were to its victory. It is no more complicated than that. However, that is not the only failure in Alaska that can be accredited to a lack of motivation and action by Christians, by far. The government has just released statistics showing Alaska as number 1 in the nation in per capita rates of violent crime. Alaska has been number 1 in suicides for some time and is number 4 in property crimes and in the top 10 of alcoholism rates. Alaska is a very dark place spiritually speaking and a large part of that is precisely because Christians are failing to take the light of Jesus Christ into the darkness of the culture here. Martin Luther King one said, â€œAnd it may come to pass that the greatest tragedy of our time will not be the words and deeds of the children of darkness but the silence and apathy of the children of light.â€ Brethren, this ought not to be so. It should not be that the neighbors around your church only get paid personal visits from the cults like Mormons and Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses. It should not be that Christians hold the light of Christ only within the four walls of a building. It should not be that churches send missionaries halfway around the world but not across the street from their own building. It should not be that the soldiers of Christ try to fight a spiritual war from the comfort of their foxholes. Jesus said that His church would prevail against the gates of Hell. Where are the courageous souls willing to charge those gates with the sword of God? Brethren , it is beyond past time for the church to arise out of its pews and start preaching in the darkest areas of our culture. It is beyond past time to confront the enemies of Christ on the battlefield of our state. If you are not motivated to go out and do battle on the battlefield then eventually the Devil will bring the battle to the altar of your church and your front door. At that point it will be too late. I beseech you as a fellow child of God to please answer the call of the shofar. To hear the trumpet blast of war. Too many battles have already been lost. Let us not lose the war for our nation. We do injustice to the men in uniform who fought for this nation and we do an injustice to the Cross of Christ that fought for our souls if we sit idly by in the comfort of our churches and refuse to go into the highways and byways and plead with the lost to come to the wedding. The church is not a building. The church is people and we are losing people every day to the enemy and most Christians just sing louder in their services to drown out the mournful cries of a lost and dying world. Let not your congregation be counted among the cowards, Brethren. Call the troops to battle. Sharpen their swords. Equip the saints for the preaching of the Gospel and then unleash the saints of heaven against the forces of Hell. Invade the streets of Anchorage with the Gospel of Christ. I pray that you hear this one voice crying in the wilderness. May God be with you. Pastor David Grisham Repent Alaska",0

You're better off using YouTube as your source of helpas the staff informed me they are only trained by watching videos, nothing more. And they're really only trained to use an iPhone and nothing else. So if you need help with your pixel or your Android you better find someone else to help you.",0
"Usually okay, but didn't have the new Samsung 20 5G Ultra screen protector or the regular Samsung 20 5G either! Had to go to a different kiosk.",0
"We love this place compared to other Yogurt Lounges. They have so many toppings to choose from and the fruit looks and tastes so fresh. Also, they have classic flavors and some fun news ones to try so everyone can get something they like. The atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable for dates, small or big groups, and they even have kids toys!",0
"Remodeled inside, very nice, warm, power outlets throughout to work with your laptop. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was inside. For a fast food restaurant, very upscale.",0
They were helpful with what I needed but not a lot of people know much about Samsung phones there,0
Bought an otterbox for my Samsung galaxy 20 ultra. They guy was kind enough to put my screen protector on free of charge and you need to have an account which i didn't have. SUPER FRIENDLY STAFF! thanks!!!! (:,0
"Does not know how to instal iPhone screen, also overpriced. I prought my cracked SE there and got it back with a bum home button, charged me $90 for half an hour of labor, if you need your screen done DO NOT go here. Edit: I just went back, they refused service to me because I was dissatisfied with the last service... really... thumbs down guys. Also you should train your tech better.",0
"I have read the reviews over all the store looks good but I was going to have them replace the batteryin my GS8+, but their contract permits them to use refurbished parts, they claim that they only use new batteries from Samsung however their contract convinced me that I don't want them to do a battery replacement in my phone",0
Great spot to work on your laptop and catch the views of the Chugach Mountains.,0
Absolutely wonderful. Had the mettalica roll and it was the bomb.com. lots of cream cheese,0
"If you enjoy an old fashioned family run diner with great food specials and the best pie in Alaska you need to eat here. Don't come in the door expecting everything to be delivered to you in minutes, this is a place to come and relax. Sit up front at the counter for daily discussions on trucks, politics and everything aero and automotive. Kick back in the dining room with family and friends, or bring a party to the upstairs party room. We always buy pies from here for the holidays, Nancy (the owner) makes all of their baked goods by hand, and will make just about any custom pie you could ask for, and many of them in sugar free!",0
"This is a very well-funded government information center and a necessary point for registering for Outback hikes and trips into the wilderness. The exhibits are very biased towards Eco extremism but still offer a good deal of information and knowledge if taken with a grain of salt. The best thing in the information center is the huge topographic 3D map of the park and surrounding areas. You can see that the 65 Mile bus ride will give you a view it's not much better than the free view from the Highway south of the park. If you're hiking the buses are great to get to trailheads but for the view they are quite expensive for what you get compared to the free Highway. Be sure to notice in the map the portion of Denali park that is owned by the state of Alaska. If this part you can hunt fish and do all kinds of activities freely. This is the opposite of the federal controlled lands. In the federal lands there are no parking, no camping signs everywhere ,pay money or go away. Once you get to the Alaska control portion of the highway there are free pull-offs south of the park that are ideal for camping overnight in an RV. No facilities but free parking great views and no harassment. Alaska is citizen-friendly! The federal government is citizen hostile, citizen manipulative, and citizen exploitive! The Visitor Center is worth going to so you can see how the parts laid out, see the free part you can enjoy on by the state of Alaska and decide whether you're going to ride buses till trailheads, buses for the view, or Joy the Freeview along the highway. If you don't Reserve Advance you're certainly not going to stay in the park with your RV",0

Horrible I was refused because of my trump hat,0
Food and prices are great. Didn't really care for the conservative news blasting in the background but it's Palmer so thats par for teh course. All in all its a good joint and one I'll visit again next time I'm in the area.,0
There was a lady with a laptop and her husband on the phone the entire movie so much for following the rules people,0
The food is good but I haven't eaten here in a year nor will I. Wendy's supports Trump and other traitors. Sometimes you have to send a message. No no no no no and no. Thank you,0
"Went to ComputerWerks to get a recently purchased, refurbished laptop repasted with new thermal compound for the GPU and CPU. Staff was very friendly, and the technician did a great job and got the work done more quickly than they had quoted, and it ended up costing less. Will be back for computer maintenance I'd rather not do myself.",0
"In the past, I've received excellent customer service. In this case however the reception person was completely rude, did not listen, was dismissive and interrupted each sentence that the person I was with and myself attempted to make. She was a horrible reception person and really shouldn't be in that position... With her General attitude and demeanor, I'm not sure she should be in any professional position without extensive customer service training. Learning the art of listening would be greatly beneficial to her and anyone - and I mean anyone professionally or personally - who has the opportunity to talk with her. Her name was Kayla. I found her services to be far below stellar and her attitude completely inappropriate rude and dismissive I tried to explain a very simple concept which she interrupted and said this is totally different and I had not yet even finished what I was about to say and when I try to say something further the person I was with said she's not listening to you. She interrupted the person I was with him said oh I am listening I just had to do this this in this. Unbelievably rude, unbelievably opinionated and arrogant. I've never had such a bad experience at GCI in my life. Normally their employees are incredibly competent both in person and over the telephone. This Kayla should not be working at the front desk or in any position without extreme and extensive customer service training. Learning the art of shutting her mouth when somebody else is speaking, especially a customer, would greatly benefit her. It would greatly benefit anyone around here. As I said earlier, this was a very negative experience and Kayla was the cause of it. What we were asking about she made sound impossible which was far from impossible. She also used the term iOS in a way to make yourself look smarter and confuse the person I was with. I had to actually say to the other person she's talking about an iPhone. I got the impression she like to Bandy a term about to make yourself seem smarter than she was and to confuse the general customer. The person I was with an I left completely dissatisfied and rather upset by her supposed customer service skills. She realized just how badly she had behaved and tried to backpedal and be a little bit more friendly when she realized that we would probably report her to a supervisor. It was painfully obvious, transparent and really quite the satisfying.",0
"Batteryplus screen repair is a good deal, if you schedule your appointment online. I got my iPhone SE screen replaced for 80 bucks.",0
They wouldnâ€™t take a 100 or a 50$ bill. Highly inconvenient. A guy tried but then manager denied it and said no. Had to go to bank 3 times before getting my pizza and now itâ€™s cold. They would t remake it. This is terrible. Email me at dalethesien@gmail.com. Iâ€™d love to talk maybe a credit or something. I want to make it a 5 star but dominoes will have to work with me and itâ€™ll become a 5 star,0
"Horrible staff! I was told I'd have to get a new iphone or Samsung, that I couldn't use my Google Pixel 4XL on the network.",0
Prices are almost all wrong. Everything rang up different than shelf prices. Employees do not know what an @ symbol means and that emails require them. Tried to help the cashier enter my email. It wouldn't take it because the cashier couldn't figure out where to put the @ in an email that is @gmail.com. anyway where else ya gonna go?,0

They still don't use Android/Samsung/Apple pay which is an annoyance. Store has a reasonable TSEM section and some board games and a good magazine section.,0
"3 stars for awesome live music, 0 for service, Iâ€™ve seen way too many people way over served here, bartenders are supposed to be trained in knowing when to cut people off. Theyâ€™re not. Anchorage is cracking down on over servering, and over indulging, also a reacuring theme here. Heads up! Soon to be in the news for bartenders and patron arrests.",0
"I went her with a friend who was upgrading to a iPhone XMax and Dalyana who assisted him was simply wonderful! Knowledgeable and funny, she made me wish that it took him more time to transfer his data to his new phone. Ask for her. Delightful young woman.",0
Smooth process. iPhone screen replaced within an hour.,0
I used to have breakfast here and use my laptop but they removed all plugins. So not remote working friendly but the food and coffee are great. Pizza is hand made and high quality.,0
"As a tourist spot, the 5th Avenue Mall is full to the brim with everything we need at immediate gadgets we can buy such as Cell Phones, Video Game Consoles, laptop computers and cloths. Come see it for yourself. And the 5th floor is reserved for food. Come get you some.",0
"Terrible, Bad service, wait is way too long for a so so burger. Government cheese, gross! Very Poor Conditions for seating and parking. Cheap, cheap, cheap food products, over priced Food. Not worth going back!",0
"It's always a good time. I would have given 5 stars, however, with signs stating no dogs, no politics and no religious orders there were dogs and religious orders. I thought no meant no.",0
These are hidden gems for military and government employees.,0
Only drive thru open due to continuing government lock down - they still serve the best donuts in Anchorage!,0
"If there was zero, this place would qualify. When you walk in with your family, all heads in the restaurant turn to glare at you and the kids, you know this is not a safe place to eat. The feeling of discontent, of being somewhere you don't belong, is intimidating. We were very respectful, but never coming here again. They are disrespectful in their manners and service. Borderline discrimination, but rather than sink to their level, we maintained our dignity and self respect. UPDATE response: It's not a matter of my opinion of any politics. I'm talking about discrimination based on my race, of calling out the establishments that perpetuate the intimidation. Sorry, you can't change how you made us feel. No one can enjoy their meal in that environment, let alone acceptable level of treatment or service.",0
"I came here needing help repairing my iPhone. A young boy(appeared to be the owners child possibly?) showed me their options for buying a used iPhone(which were rather steeply priced) and when I explained my situation- he continued to show me the phones for sale, but no other options were discussed and no other employees were available to help me. I essentially received no help and no service during my visit here.",0
Very helpful. My wife and I both changed cell phone service to GCI and got new phones. Friendly knowledgeable staff walked us through the GCI system to make sure we could get the best use of our new Samsung phones. We highly recommend the Soldotna Alaska store.,0
Great pictures and news articles from the quake of 1964. Slightly cheesy movie supposed to look like a 60's documentary features footage from quake aftermath-- and the seats rock to show the force of the quake.,0
"Wasn't impressed. Too busy trying to push their politics off to give good service or make a drinkable beer. 3 friends from the lower 48 said ""if this is what Alaska beer tastes like we'd rather drink water"". Was embarrassing to say the least.",0
"Quick and professional experience with replacing the glass on my iPhone. My only reason for a four-star review is because there were someone bubbles in my new iPhone screen and the technician said, â€œYouâ€™ll have to work them out.â€ I would hope that after paying a $130 this wouldâ€™ve been done for me.",0

"Jay even has a Bitcoin machine. He gets you what you need, even before you thought you needed it!",0
"It's a real old-fashioned barbershop, with 4 chairs and 4 barbers on the busy days. For the price of a cut at a barber college you get an experienced barber to cut your hair. Conversation is usually pretty good, ranging from duck recipes to oil prices and the local news, and old days stories about the Alyeska Pipeline getting put in. Hours vary - however, if they have enough people to last till quittin' time, they lock the doors. No ""Last Minute Larry's"" here!",0
"Absolutely awesome service. I needed title work done and the process was a little longer than at the DMV because they had to get the state's approval for lost title etc.. Their service includes the agent there filling out forms for you and all I needed to do was sign and date. Of course they charge a fee for their service, more than the dmv, but it's completely worth it. The wait time was no longer than 15 minutes. I got my title printed right there half hour later and after paying, was on my jolly way. The staff are all very helpful and I never once felt a reason to bring out ""the Karen"". These wonderful people will take any form of payment (card/cash). No bitcoin yet! Slow down! Anyway, would I go here again? Absolutely! Would I recommend others to go here? Definitely! Would I give them a great review? In a heartbeat! I'm pretty level headed about reviews and only give more than four stars if I can't think of any way for a business to improve.",0
Hard to run and play (in the smoke). The good news. The mosquitoes will go extinct before We do ??,0
"Love this place and our dogs love it too! There's a large, open field and about a 1 mile loop around a small lake that are both off-leash. The terrain is uneven most of the way, if that's a factor. There are no completely fenced in areas and multiple trails feed into the loop all the way around so bring a leash if your dog has a tendency to wander too far away. The lake water is accessible at many points along the walk, which our 2 love, but pay attention to recent news and signs posted for moose, bears, aggressive beavers and water-borne pathogens.",0
"The bathroom was totally out of toilet paper and the staff was grumpy about having to restock the toilet paper. She even told me that the empty slot slides over to the next roll of paper. I told her that both of the slots were empty. The good news is that she did was her hands thoroughly before returning to making ice cream orders. I'll wait until next week to revisit the store, as she'll be on vacation then.",0
The place was shut down because of the government shutdown. We still had an awesome time here. Did the trails and drove into the park. If you want to come you should it's open and the snow plow is clearing the roads in the park...,0
"Awesome, after dealing with the government run DMV in the lower 48, these gals are very refreshing. Thumbs up to Christine who helped us.",0
"It had the gates closed on a holiday weekend, parked at the gates and walked down to find absolutely no reason to deny access to lookout, just government being lazy !! Veiw was outstanding, so beautiful, but southern veiw is better.",0
"The library is great. Simple setting with different sections; childrens area, movies, newspapers and magazines, book series, computers to use, a study area, shelves are alphabetically and numerically organized making finding what you need more convenient. The barista in the hall is also really good, has a selection of hot beverages to choose from, I personally like the vanilla chai. They hold several different events and meetings in the theater area; movies every now and then, coucil meetings, dog shows, high school proms and balls, the saturday market. The museum is a bit basic with cultural heritage and items used by recent ancestors. It could use a few more things in there like native plants found around the area. The gift shop is a neat little area, my mom used to work there when I was young, been a while since I've taken a look in there. I do love the free books shelf when you first walk into the cultural center, along with the bulletin board of news and ads. Great place.",0
"The Seoul Casa is a unique restaurant. You'll find Tex-Mex with a Korean taste. Kim-chi is found in many of the menu items which is interesting, but if I had to say the best tasting ingredient it would be the meat. The chicken and beef are very flavorful. The seasoning is mostly spicy and I have good news, the food is extra spicy the next day should you have leftovers. The employees are very polite and they do a great job of suggesting entrees. The 3 Amigos Tacos is one of their most popular entrees. The Supreme Kim-chi Tots is a massive plate and the sauce is very spicy, so make sure you share!

This is my favorite go-to place for a scrumptious brunch. The food is wholesome and eclectic and delicious. Staff are very friendly. Wait time was very reasonable. Every time I come here I leave very full and happy. Great place for coffee and work on a laptop as well. Casual. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options and options for those with food allergies.,0

"If you want something that might fall under the umbrella of ""nerdy,"" this is the place in Alaska to go. Magic: the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh and other trading card games. Retro video games, from cartridge to console. Role playing games from D&D, Pathfinder, Numenara, Fate and more. Miniatures for fantasy roleplaying or Warhammer. Model paints, washes, and brushes. Comic books from Marvel, DC, Icon, Dark Horse. Manga, anime movies and TV shows. Polyhedral dice sets, board games, replica swords, franchise statues and graphic tees. Imported candies. I have yet to see the Comic Shop of Fairbanks' match in any of my travels. They are a community hub, hosting game nights for TCGs, wargaming, and even starting a series of how to paint minis.

"The locals call this place ""the hallway"" because that's literally all there is. The good news is that there is a Michaels in town. The bad news is that Michaels and Safeway are the anchor stores. Otherwise, you have icing and like American Eagle to shop, which is convenient when you are talking 6 hours to the next closest mall. No food court. It's not really a mall by Lower 48 standards, but it does the job. They always do a Halloween thing for the kids, which is fun since it's freezing cold outside every October 31.",0
"With all my family 3000 miles away and a few recent bad experiences with mechanics either misdiagnosing my vehicle issues or one just being down right rude-I asked close friends for a referral to a mechanic. Reformed Automotive was MORE than a breath of fresh air. Jeremiah first asked me what I was hoping for and he really listened to my concerns not only about my vehicle but how I felt I had been talked to by other mechanics, like they assume if they tell me in detail what is wrong with my car I wouldn't understand (I use to be married to a mechanic). He really listened and I got the feeling I would not have had to tell anyone at Reformed Automotive that I wanted to be shown respect in our dealings. Jeremiah was truthful and respectful in delivering the bad news about my car issues, telling me exactly what was wrong, and even helpful in giving me direction of who to talk to when I mentioned where I was going to go to car hunt. After delivering such bad news, it was nice to know that I wasn't even going to be charged for the assessment. It was FINALLY the best experience - HANDS DOWN-I have had at an auto shop in the past 11 years that I have been in Alaska. I am now a customer for LIFE! Everyone I have spoke to on the phone was friendly and respectful.",0

"If you're in downtown Anchorage and you're looking for fine dining then you can't beat Orso. The Orso signature dish is the Orso Lamb Shank. The Orso Lamb Shank is the only entree that has never been removed from the menu since the opening of the restaurant in May 2000. Our server Sharay S. was absolutely excellent! I suggest asking for her table on your next visit. The Orso restaurant (6,000 sq. ft) contains two floors that seat 190 people with a bar on the first floor. The second floor is often reserved for private parties, however also used for public seating. The restrooms are on the first floor behind the stairs. I've been told the women's restroom has heated seats. Orso (Italian for ""Bear""), also known as ""Ristorante Orso"" was developed by Glacier BrewHouse owners Chris Anderson and Bob Acree in 1999 according to the article written by Melissa Devaughn, Alaska Daily News, Sept. 15, 2000.

"The first time I had a pizza from here, it was very disappointing quality. Couldn't taste the toppings through the layers of carbon, yes it was very burnt. My pecan pie did not come with utensils; the gelato melted. Ordered via 907 delivery. A couple days later, I ordered a new pizza and it was actually really good. A consistent wood fired flavor without the excessive carbon coating. I've included the before and after photos. Good news: Management is very nice and is all about QC. I don't know if their ovens are too hot or if their cooks are too preoccupied on a Tuesday night-- but, they did offer to make it right. I would try this place again.",0

"Service was great! Went in to purchase a new hands gun (.45) process was simple and concise. Instead of filling out forms in paper, everything is digital and completed on a tablet. This minimizes questionable handwriting and mistakes in getting clearance for the sale. I'd highly recommend the firearms service counter and the gentleman that helped me out. Just remember: bring your government issued ID with your physical and a government form, of some sort, that has your physical address if your ID only has a PO Box.",0

A visit to the actual Alaskan Brewery in Juneau. Good news is you get to sample the beers. Bad news is there is no Brewery tour. Shame. It also sells a selection of merchandise. There is one IPA that is not available anywhere else so worth a trip to sample that.,0

Always great and easy to catch a flight. Love the new decorations and wildlife exhibits. Only 3 stars because every TV is turned to fake news provided by GCI... I guess I'm switching to ACS.,0
The staff here are ereally great. They've always helpped my find and compare hardware and always helpped me when I asked. The last time I was in to buy a high end gamaing laptop I was in there for 2 hours and they were happy to help!,0
"This is the only coffee shop I goto when I come to anchorage! Kaladi bros quality, atmosphere is perfect cafe style. Work on your laptop, read a book, whatever! Best coffee mugs around too! Oh and the poppy seed muffins are...awful (just playing, I am just tired of them being out of those magical muffins!!!!)",0
"Ate here a number of years ago and the ramen was absolutely delicious. Love how the interior design of the restaurant is focused on creating a Japanese-focused environment. You've got Japanese posters on the wall, two TV's playing Japanese media (either news or anime), and the staff is very welcoming.",0
"They actually care, and they are government employees. Amazing!",0
"The service was great, the only part I had trouble with was there menus are all digital so you have to take a picture of their QR code and get the menu through your phone if you have an iPhone it's easy but if you have an Android with no QR reader it's a slight pain in the rear. But the food was great and they respect the 6-ft distance for Covid. My experience for the place overall was wonderful I rarely go to more spend your places, but if you have the money and want to a nice treat I recommend Spenard Roadhouse.",0
"Remodeled inside, very nice, warm, power outlets throughout to work with your laptop. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was inside. For a fast food restaurant, very upscale.",0
"As a store - customer service is moderately helpful... But while many common electronics can be found here, cheaper AND better stuff is all over Amazon. For example- if you are spending over $40 on an HDMI your wallet is getting completely trainwrecked. Search Amazon for ""Bluerigger HDMI"" instead... Another common problem is people coming in to get a laptop when they are very unfamiliar with the topic... Again Newegg and Amazon are the best here, try Lenovo Dell or Asus for midline quality, and MSI, Sager or expensive ASUS options for gaming/high performance. Lastly, stay away from Best Buy protection plans...the item either won't need it or already has as an acceptable manufacturer's warranty.",0
The technicians understood the problem with my iPhone and corrected it the day I brought it in. I was able to collect my phone later the same day.,0
Very helpful. My wife and I both changed cell phone service to GCI and got new phones. Friendly knowledgeable staff walked us through the GCI system to make sure we could get the best use of our new Samsung phones. We highly recommend the Soldotna Alaska store.,0
"Had everything I needed, I don't understand the reason they don't price match the items on walmart.com that can be picked up instore via the website.",0
Great coffee and really good breakfast food selection. Perfect place to grab a coffee and get some work done on a laptop on a weekend morning.,0
Good central location. Staff is friendly and supportive during our stay. Make sure to use the government rate for additional discounts if you qualify.,0
"Quick and professional experience with replacing the glass on my iPhone. My only reason for a four-star review is because there were someone bubbles in my new iPhone screen and the technician said, â€œYouâ€™ll have to work them out.â€ I would hope that after paying a $130 this wouldâ€™ve been done for me.",0
Friendly staff and great service all around! I live my truck and they help me take good care of it. One thing I would change would be the constant political news in the waiting room. Thankfully they have a TV free place by the coffee many of us chose to sit at instead.,0
The technicians understood the problem with my iPhone and corrected it the day I brought it in. I was able to collect my phone later the same day.,0

"ALASKA Christians: STOP BURYING YOUR TALENTS Dear Christian, Proposition 1 has failed. It failed because the enemies of God were more motivated to its defeat than the children of God were to its victory. It is no more complicated than that. However, that is not the only failure in Alaska that can be accredited to a lack of motivation and action by Christians, by far. The government has just released statistics showing Alaska as number 1 in the nation in per capita rates of violent crime. Alaska has been number 1 in suicides for some time and is number 4 in property crimes and in the top 10 of alcoholism rates. Alaska is a very dark place spiritually speaking and a large part of that is precisely because Christians are failing to take the light of Jesus Christ into the darkness of the culture here. Martin Luther King one said, â€œAnd it may come to pass that the greatest tragedy of our time will not be the words and deeds of the children of darkness but the silence and apathy of the children of light.â€ Brethren, this ought not to be so. It should not be that the neighbors around your church only get paid personal visits from the cults like Mormons and Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses. It should not be that Christians hold the light of Christ only within the four walls of a building. It should not be that churches send missionaries halfway around the world but not across the street from their own building. It should not be that the soldiers of Christ try to fight a spiritual war from the comfort of their foxholes. Jesus said that His church would prevail against the gates of Hell. Where are the courageous souls willing to charge those gates with the sword of God? Brethren , it is beyond past time for the church to arise out of its pews and start preaching in the darkest areas of our culture. It is beyond past time to confront the enemies of Christ on the battlefield of our state. If you are not motivated to go out and do battle on the battlefield then eventually the Devil will bring the battle to the altar of your church and your front door. At that point it will be too late. I beseech you as a fellow child of God to please answer the call of the shofar. To hear the trumpet blast of war. Too many battles have already been lost. Let us not lose the war for our nation. We do injustice to the men in uniform who fought for this nation and we do an injustice to the Cross of Christ that fought for our souls if we sit idly by in the comfort of our churches and refuse to go into the highways and byways and plead with the lost to come to the wedding. The church is not a building. The church is people and we are losing people every day to the enemy and most Christians just sing louder in their services to drown out the mournful cries of a lost and dying world. Let not your congregation be counted among the cowards, Brethren. Call the troops to battle. Sharpen their swords. Equip the saints for the preaching of the Gospel and then unleash the saints of heaven against the forces of Hell. Invade the streets of Anchorage with the Gospel of Christ. I pray that you hear this one voice crying in the wilderness. May God be with you. Pastor David Grisham Repent Alaska",0
"Great help from sales associate, no hard sell, good price on the perfect laptop.",0
"I wish I had not gone to this store... it can only accommodate 1 person at a time.. Each employee that works there says they are the manager... Anyways had I known that they were not an Official Verizon Store I would have looked elsewhere... They cannot even add your Military Discount to your account, I had to go to the Official Verizon Store in the Diamond Center and they took care of me in about a minute... uploaded my ID Card to my Account ... Also John at the Diamond Store of Go WIRELESS had me pay off my Note 9 512 GB so I could get my other one free and told me that the one I paid off could leave their network on 10/6/2018 .. Now I have the District Manager saying that he cannot allow that and John ,he would have to verify, and Lindsey they fired for stealing according to the gal that worked last week at the Tudor Store ... she also said she was the manager and would send the District Manager a message to contact me... I guess he never got it or he did not care.. when I spoke with him this afternoon he said he had spoken with me many times and I had said that this was the 2nd time... I did the BOGO Pre-order of 2 note 9 512gb 1 blue and 1 Purple which got screwed up I kept getting promised that my phone was being FedEx by Lindsy and her District Manager John told me to buy out the Purple Note 9 512 GB and would get the other one free plus the Purple one can leave the system on 10/6/2018.. I checked my Verizon account and found that someone had removed the credit from my account that is wht prompted me to check before I transferred my wife's phone to other carrier.. Lindsey gave me a note 9 128 GB Purple as a loaner till mine was to arrive in the 2 days which never happened.. phone never arrived... Samsung Duo Charger never received... when I spoke to the District Manager, he was well aware of what needed to be done... Still waiting for 1249.00 credit on my account Big waste of time with this business... Oh.. I ordered a Samsung Duo Charger from Ebay for 80 bucks ... never opened their single Charger.. why would I want a single one when I have 2 phones...",0
"The bathroom was totally out of toilet paper and the staff was grumpy about having to restock the toilet paper. She even told me that the empty slot slides over to the next roll of paper. I told her that both of the slots were empty. The good news is that she did was her hands thoroughly before returning to making ice cream orders. I'll wait until next week to revisit the store, as she'll be on vacation then.",0
They still don't use Android/Samsung/Apple pay which is an annoyance. Store has a reasonable TSEM section and some board games and a good magazine section.,0
Wonderful funky and casual little coffee spot. I like non-chain coffee shops a lot and this one did not disappoint. A great place to go and get some work done on the laptop while enjoying a delicious coffee beverage.,0
"Website stinks, can't find what I need, enjoy the actual news.",0
They do their job but there are some issues with the store such as getting a new phone and it needs 5 hours of updates That you can only download with Wi-Fi Creating a 1/2 full in where I lived there is no Wi-Fi or in the immediate area need to tether the phone to use the laptop You think when you buy a new phone that all the updates would be pre installed ahead a time,0
In all honesty the tech at Wal-Mart knows more about the phones and devices in AT&T then the AT&T sales person. They can't give me any information I want. I know iPhones and Samsung's sell them selves but when I'm trying to compare phones for what's right for me it isn't an iPhone versus a galaxy. I want all my options. The staff is undertrained. They don't even know what the plans they have are. The staff blame it on AT&T always changing the deals. I believe you should be aware. I left and went to GCI and got a phone from them. Service was by far better.,0
This place is strange for shelter everything echoes and certain staff are very mean and not very good food and people demoralizing you by watching you shower while on there phone no public restroom and people coughing all the time and only Polly John Trump wall . Not enough blankets or clothes.,0
"This is one of the coziest spaces in Anchorage - a perfect little getaway where you can bring a book or your laptop in peace. It's usually very busy, but even then, not noisy. Their food is unique and delicious, hot cocoa is wonderful, and I love their bread pudding! And the staff is super friendly and make the vibe of the place great.",0
"Nice, clean store. Overall, it's fairly priced and usually quality products. Be mindfull... if it's a cabelas branded product..it could be 2 to 3 times higher priced than some other well known brands. Also, at the same time, sometimes the cabelas branded products are sometimes 2 to 3 times cheaper. Just look at multiple sources. Sometimes online at cabelas.com it's cheaper or find good deals. Example...cabelas tents are 2 to 3 times more expensive than a Coleman or other brand, but the quality of cabelas is higher than a coleman. Fishing line, cabelas brand is cheaper.. so just look at ALL the options. OVERALL, I shop here 20 to 30 times a year. Keep an eye out for online deals and get a rewards card for sure!",0

"I am just getting home from a root canal on a very painful canine done with IV sedation. My high metabolism and body make IV sedation difficult to achieve, even real general anesthesiologists for in hospital surgeries have been shocked and made notes that the stuff does work on me right and it takes a ton to keep me out and I wake fully alert the moment they stop administering. I made this clear to the original dentist I saw and was assured it wouldn't be a problem and they understood and would make sure not to proceed until I was comfortable and where I needed to be. So I paid the 1400 up front for IV knowing I wouldn't be able to fix any of my other desperate teeth until July because the IV sedation ate up all insurance and care credit. My appointment was this morning. I just got home less than an hour ago. Do I seem even slightly medicated? Because I'm not. Never was. Through entire procedure I repeatedly said I was not sedated and fully alert and in pain. And was ignored 98% of the time and the issue was never fixed. I had to sit through the root canal with pain and wide awake. Clearly worth 1400 right? I could have driven my family home from appointment. Absolutely zero medication effects. This was a COMPLETE waste. I've had other dentists actually IV sedate me as it has to be done for every single procedure I need and was completely different and actually sedated me. I don't remember those appointments. I clearly know every moment of this appointment. I was NOT properly sedated. I am 110% awake, alert, and feel no different than had I been given zero meds today. So clearly your ""IV sedation"" wasn't performed as well as it should have been and I may as well have saved money and just let them do it with me awake and feeling it all, because that's exactly how it went but I got to spend 1400 for the experience. I will never be a sucker for that office and their fancy new Samsung Tv's and overexpensive decor etc. I dont care if you've got a 60 inch flat screen in every procedure room. Thanks for having me help pay for it though just to get screwed on the sedation and be fully alert. Truly appreciated. Could care less about your tv screens. Especially when, if the service I paid for was actually done properly for a patient outside of the norm, I wouldn't have been noticing the tv in the first place. Fool me once I guess. I'm so upset I can't even fix my other front teeth before insurance reset in July and they won't last that long all because I spent 1400 bucks for the IV that was useless. Nah, I will definitely be heading to a dentist that pays attention during a procedure when you tell them it hurts and you're wide awake and alert etc. One that lives up to and follows the agreed upon plan and acknowledges issues. One that cares more for the patient than a fancy office. And will be sharing my experience as much as possible. Maybe can save someone else the misery and the money.",0

Wonderful customer service and great food! I really wanted to try birria tacos and thankfully I saw on their Facebook that they had them. The food was really yummy and definitely the best birria tacos I've had yet. I ordered on their website instead of Doordash and it was a great decision - got 10% off since it was my first order. I will for sure be ordering from them again soon!,0
"Iâ€™ve had a lot, A LOT of pizza in my life. This by far blows it all out of the water. Best pizza ever! They have options for everyone. If youâ€™re feeling spicy, my favorite is the Spicy Pizza (pepperoni sausage and jalapeÃ±os). They also have plenty of non-spicy options. Their crust is AMAZING! And better news folks, THEY SELL THEIR DOUGH! Great way to make some pizzas with the kiddos! Highly recommend.",0

"With all my family 3000 miles away and a few recent bad experiences with mechanics either misdiagnosing my vehicle issues or one just being down right rude-I asked close friends for a referral to a mechanic. Reformed Automotive was MORE than a breath of fresh air. Jeremiah first asked me what I was hoping for and he really listened to my concerns not only about my vehicle but how I felt I had been talked to by other mechanics, like they assume if they tell me in detail what is wrong with my car I wouldn't understand (I use to be married to a mechanic). He really listened and I got the feeling I would not have had to tell anyone at Reformed Automotive that I wanted to be shown respect in our dealings. Jeremiah was truthful and respectful in delivering the bad news about my car issues, telling me exactly what was wrong, and even helpful in giving me direction of who to talk to when I mentioned where I was going to go to car hunt. After delivering such bad news, it was nice to know that I wasn't even going to be charged for the assessment. It was FINALLY the best experience - HANDS DOWN-I have had at an auto shop in the past 11 years that I have been in Alaska. I am now a customer for LIFE! Everyone I have spoke to on the phone was friendly and respectful.",1

I like this place but could do without the polital signs at the greenhouse entry. Can't we even go shopping without politics?,1
"Outstanding Doctors at BACH~! I've been to ""Doctors"" off base in Fairbanks and don't feel comfortable with the ones I've seen. Here are some of the reasons. 1. This is Fairbanks, AK - the end of the earth - It's 350 miles to eat dinner; the temp is <0 for most of the winter; nothing for the doctor's children to do; crime is well above the national average; the population is not well educated; things are unreasonably expensive; Had a general anesthesia procedure at Fairbanks Memorial - came out of it with bruises all over my arms, patches of skin missing from my chest, and pain in my arms - as if I had been in a car wreck. I asked all the questions - but the staff at FMH refused to answer any questions. The doctors off base are not always board certified - and they certainly don't offer that information. The off post doctors are so crooked the US Govt is conducting surveys because of bilking insurance companies and medicare. The equipment off post is antiquated and dirty - as if it's only there to satisfy a basic necessity for some inspector. The doctors off base routinely ""order"" unnecessary lab test as reported in the news and court filings. The military community in the Fairbanks area is LUCKY! to have BACH - as everything that's wrong off post is absent at BACH! I'm so grateful for the doctors that are assigned here - they should all get follow-on assignments to their dream location. Thank you.",1

If you're visiting the Ophthalmic Associates I hope you have positive news too, however I'm confident that you're in the right place no matter the situation. Parking is a little strange here, but there is a parking lot next door and it's free. Make sure the parking sign says, ""Ophthalmic Associates"" or you're in the wrong parking lot. There are stairs, many stairs, so expect a mild workout to visit the waiting rooms and restrooms. Cell phone coverage was fine downstairs, but the Internet connection will be much slower.

I hadn't been here in like 5 or 8 years. Bread sticks were still how I remember and delicious. Salad and dressing good. 4 cheese ziti was decent but the artichoke spinach dip was pretty lame. I dont know what happened there. Also they helped me figure out Samsung pay at the to go kiosk. They seemed wowed by the technology but I mean come on its 2019 we should be buying food with a retina scan. Lol,1
"Just about every time I go into Western Auto I discover they carry something I didn't know they carry. Like, wait. Western Auto carries appliances? And there is a very decent if small selection of appliances. Wait... I can get a mouse for my laptop here? Holy smokes! I wish I'd known about their science kits for kids before Christmas! And that's just the bottom floor. There's a whole floor above of marine equipment and sporting goods that you could just wander around in for hours. Their prices are decent for Alaska. Service is always very good- you never have to look long for someone to help you find something. So now if I'm on my way to Fred's or Home Depot for some household good, I check in at Western first, just to see. They don't always have what I need, (no SAD lamps!) but very often they do, and a decent or sometimes better price, probably a higher quality version, and with much better service. I would rather give them my money!",1

I mean, i saw the excitement leave the person's face as they shook a little like a transformation. Then rudeness after. Kind of a spectacle now that I think about it. LOL.

Also, the walmart.com app is not accurate for their inventory. For example it shows they have Airpods - and even their own system shows they have them - but after driving there and waiting 45 minutes they couldn't find them. And this is like the 3rd time that has happened with products shown on walmart.com as in stock. It makes me realize that Amazon or Target will win the retail battle - because Walmart just won't staff enough to serve the customers orders and needs.",1

"Definitely not a consignment shop with an attention to detail. Math and money are always in their favor, they play games with paying congsignors. The old â€œcheck is in the mail routineâ€. Last payment I received was for $8 after they took out $8 for Craigslist ad fees. Never was discussed or mentioned that they would take fees from consignors for Craigslist ads. I post on Craigslist for free anyway. Had items sit in their showroom for a year with no price tags on them. Every time I had a concern or comment it was rebuffed with immediate excuses and rationalization of how things are done. I felt ripped off after consigning here. Constantly given the run around and have to stop back repeatedly to resolve anything. Iâ€™d recommend another place or just sell on Craigslist as I did. Family run operation with family social politics and inefficiency. They have zero regard for consignors unless youâ€™re selling bigger ticket items that make them more money. Consigning smaller items puts you on the pay no mind list. Donâ€™t expect to get any respectable pay for your items. They have to many mouths to feed under their business model and it comes out of the consignors cut. I tried supporting Local and regret it due to their unprofessional business practices. Try talking you into using store credit so they donâ€™t have to make payouts plus then they sell more items from their shop. Iâ€™m just not a fan of the games they play and how they run a business. They will not adapt or change tactics despite multiple customer complaints. Good luck",1

"After being a twenty year client of this Vet, I was surprised to find out how unqualified they are!! In October 2019, I made an appointment to get our Yorkie in for an appointment because she could not use her limps and could barely stand up. The Vet made a diagnoses as GME and prescribed 10 mg cortisone tablets twice a day. Our little Yorkie responded in two days and we ween her off the medication. Fast forward 6 months and our little Yorkie had the same symptoms and could not walk or use her limbs. We tried to get an appointment at this Vet during this Covid-19 but to no avail; not a return phone call for over 36 hours for an emergency condition. We went to Pet ER here in Anchorage and they contact Tier 1 in Palmer which had an Orthopedic Surgeon available. In the fall of 2019, We were informed by Vets at Pet Stop we had no Orthopedic Surgeon/Doctors in Alaska; of course we believe them, they were our vet for 20 years. So, we took our little girl to the Palmer and an MRI was performed and the results were absolutely shocking; she had 4 ruptured disc in her neck!! We were devastated at this news. However, this was our little girl and the surgeon gave us high hopes for recovery if she had surgery. She required immediate surgery because she lost function of her limbs. So, this became a no-brainer and we hope for the best however, our little girl did not make it out of recovery; trying to repair two budging disc at one time seemed to be too much and she took her trip across the rainbow bridge. We could have had better results if this diagnoses was revealed in October 2019 instead of the GME diagnoses. What really hit home was the Vet stating there was no orthopedic doctors here in Alaska and it turned out there are at least three available. So, I would really use extreme caution when given a diagnoses that this Vet Clinic. Also, please check the qualifications of each veterinarian on staff to gain a comfort level and most of all, get a second opinion!!! We lost our little girl because we put all our faith in this Vet Clinic and it definitely was the wrong thing to do. In addition, we are moving out of Alaska and we had an appointment to get our pets vaccinate on March 26, 2020; they cancelled the appointment and told us to reschedule one week before we leave Alaska; we called today and now it is impossible to meet that schedule of one week. We have lost all faith in this Vet Clinic and I will be glad to put Alaska behind us because of all the smoke and mirrors that comes from these people.",1

"Headed in for my first forest fair in years, super excited to see all the new vendors, meet cool people and see what the bier garden is all about. Unfortunately the have massively outgrown their space and are in need of a new location. (Or frankly, less vendors) The bier garden -requires- you to purchase a $7 stainless steel cup, plus the $6 beer to drink. They then expect you to -reuse- this cup for any further drinks, which is a serious health code violation. There are signs up and down the alyeska highway stating ""no politics, no religion, and no dogs."" The latter they could promise, but there was a man standing in the middle of the fair holding an umbrella about ""fearing the lord"" and trying to pass out pamphlets about his religion. I dont care what kind of court case was had to let him in, but security had no problem with him prancing around. Dont think ill be going back anytime soon. Not a summer day I enjoyed. The magic of the fair is lost, and is just a consumer market. Please do better",1

"I had to get a replacement SIM, but had to return as it wouldn't work properly once I left the store. I would recommend customers who are looking to purchase a mobile to do your own research, to be a knowledgeable consume and buy a GSM factory unlocked phone that would work with AT&T, T-mobile from Amazon or eBay. For an Apple iphone, SE 128GB for the best value or 8 256GB for better value, not the latest nor bleeding edge technology. For Android, look for one with Android One, free of bloatware, i.e. Motorola Moto X4 64GB 4GB RAM, it's an older model now but supports the frequencies used by AT&T. Buying a mobile from AT&T would generally be a locked phone, meaning it would only work on their network unless you request that it be unlocked after you have service with them for one year. Unlocked phones allow you to use any GSM network. Using AT&T is more expensive, it is also the largest coverage network, usually competent service. Inquire about the prepaid plans online. One of their plans offers 8GB of data each month provided you prepaid up front for 12 months.",1

Borderline discrimination, but rather than sink to their level, we maintained our dignity and self respect. UPDATE response: It's not a matter of my opinion of any politics.

"This is a very well-funded government information center and a necessary point for registering for Outback hikes and trips into the wilderness. The exhibits are very biased towards Eco extremism but still offer a good deal of information and knowledge if taken with a grain of salt. The best thing in the information center is the huge topographic 3D map of the park and surrounding areas. You can see that the 65 Mile bus ride will give you a view it's not much better than the free view from the Highway south of the park. If you're hiking the buses are great to get to trailheads but for the view they are quite expensive for what you get compared to the free Highway. Be sure to notice in the map the portion of Denali park that is owned by the state of Alaska. If this part you can hunt fish and do all kinds of activities freely. This is the opposite of the federal controlled lands. In the federal lands there are no parking, no camping signs everywhere ,pay money or go away. Once you get to the Alaska control portion of the highway there are free pull-offs south of the park that are ideal for camping overnight in an RV. No facilities but free parking great views and no harassment. Alaska is citizen-friendly! The federal government is citizen hostile, citizen manipulative, and citizen exploitive! The Visitor Center is worth going to so you can see how the parts laid out, see the free part you can enjoy on by the state of Alaska and decide whether you're going to ride buses till trailheads, buses for the view, or Joy the Freeview along the highway. If you don't Reserve Advance you're certainly not going to stay in the park with your RV",1

Good thing our bank blocked these charges!!! Its a total scam and they save card numbers and run them later! If you want their pizza, order over the phone and ask for the %20 online discount, but dont trust their site!!",1

"Was not super happy I had to go back in three times because the pump was being squirrelly, just to be told that I had pay again because the cashier had to reset the pump, but good news, I might get the first 20.00 back in a couple of days... Then I was told it was not their fault when I voiced my anger because I needed that first 20.00 for food. grrrrrr!",1
"The door is locked due to Covid-19. The two children (employees) are sitting behind the counter staring at their phones. When I knock on the door, neither looks up. I call and get the phone tree. Finally one of them answers and I ask if they have a product. The employee tells me they can make them. I ask how long and she tells me they have to order the material from their website and it takes 1-2 weeks. I asked if their website is Amazon.com This is a store that provides service for people an IQ below 70. I'm embarrassed to know that retail stores like this are opened longer than a few months. If you think these kids can do something - I feel sorry for you.",1

"In the past, I've received excellent customer service. In this case however the reception person was completely rude, did not listen, was dismissive and interrupted each sentence that the person I was with and myself attempted to make. She was a horrible reception person and really shouldn't be in that position... With her General attitude and demeanor, I'm not sure she should be in any professional position without extensive customer service training. Learning the art of listening would be greatly beneficial to her and anyone - and I mean anyone professionally or personally - who has the opportunity to talk with her. Her name was Kayla. I found her services to be far below stellar and her attitude completely inappropriate rude and dismissive I tried to explain a very simple concept which she interrupted and said this is totally different and I had not yet even finished what I was about to say and when I try to say something further the person I was with said she's not listening to you. She interrupted the person I was with him said oh I am listening I just had to do this this in this. Unbelievably rude, unbelievably opinionated and arrogant. I've never had such a bad experience at GCI in my life. Normally their employees are incredibly competent both in person and over the telephone. This Kayla should not be working at the front desk or in any position without extreme and extensive customer service training. Learning the art of shutting her mouth when somebody else is speaking, especially a customer, would greatly benefit her. It would greatly benefit anyone around here. As I said earlier, this was a very negative experience and Kayla was the cause of it. What we were asking about she made sound impossible which was far from impossible. She also used the term iOS in a way to make yourself look smarter and confuse the person I was with. I had to actually say to the other person she's talking about an iPhone. I got the impression she like to Bandy a term about to make yourself seem smarter than she was and to confuse the general customer. The person I was with an I left completely dissatisfied and rather upset by her supposed customer service skills. She realized just how badly she had behaved and tried to backpedal and be a little bit more friendly when she realized that we would probably report her to a supervisor. It was painfully obvious, transparent and really quite the satisfying.",1
Thanks it can't all be good news but at least you shared with us everything that other mechanic shops would not. haven't gotten service there yet but I would trust,1

This is the 2nd store I've called in Anchorage about their new wings which have been being talked about on social media and news outlets. Apparently they are not doing the new wings which are supposed to be 10 for 7.99. Update: called back and was told to contact the franchise owner Ian ianhurd@dominosalaska.com to figure what's going on. So if anyone has future issues with food quality or issues in general just send an email to that address is what I was told. Would like to see these new wings in Alaska stores soon.,1

"Leroy's is an institution in Anchorage. It is the quintessential hangover / late night cafe, always serving the greasy, terrible-for-you goodness that your intoxicated mind craves. I subtract a star because their TV is usually playing One America News, which is the TV equivalent of the comments section of ADN's website. That said, their scrambles, French dip, burgers, and tuna Sammy never fail to satisfy.",1
"In addition to running more than two hours over schedule the captain talked nonstop passing a lot of incorrect or extemporaneous information. He clearly hates millennials, does not believe in climate change and thinks the government of Valdez is corrupt. The scenery of Prince William Sound was incredible or else this would be a 1 star review. I do not recommend this tour. Call Stan Stephens for your tour needs in Valdez. Not enough indoor seating for inclement weather. His crew was fantastic. I don't know how they put up with Fred's verbal diarrhea day after day .",1
"Outstanding Doctors at BACH~! I've been to ""Doctors"" off base in Fairbanks and don't feel comfortable with the ones I've seen. Here are some of the reasons. 1. This is Fairbanks, AK - the end of the earth - It's 350 miles to eat dinner; the temp is <0 for most of the winter; nothing for the doctor's children to do; crime is well above the national average; the population is not well educated; things are unreasonably expensive; Had a general anesthesia procedure at Fairbanks Memorial - came out of it with bruises all over my arms, patches of skin missing from my chest, and pain in my arms - as if I had been in a car wreck. I asked all the questions - but the staff at FMH refused to answer any questions. The doctors off base are not always board certified - and they certainly don't offer that information. The off post doctors are so crooked the US Govt is conducting surveys because of bilking insurance companies and medicare. The equipment off post is antiquated and dirty - as if it's only there to satisfy a basic necessity for some inspector. The doctors off base routinely ""order"" unnecessary lab test as reported in the news and court filings. The military community in the Fairbanks area is LUCKY! to have BACH - as everything that's wrong off post is absent at BACH! I'm so grateful for the doctors that are assigned here - they should all get follow-on assignments to their dream location. Thank you.",1
This place is strange for shelter everything echoes and certain staff are very mean and not very good food and people demoralizing you by watching you shower while on there phone no public restroom and people coughing all the time and only Polly John Trump wall . Not enough blankets or clothes.,1

"As a store - customer service is moderately helpful... But while many common electronics can be found here, cheaper AND better stuff is all over Amazon. For example- if you are spending over $40 on an HDMI your wallet is getting completely trainwrecked. Search Amazon for ""Bluerigger HDMI"" instead... Another common problem is people coming in to get a laptop when they are very unfamiliar with the topic... Again Newegg and Amazon are the best here, try Lenovo Dell or Asus for midline quality, and MSI, Sager or expensive ASUS options for gaming/high performance. Lastly, stay away from Best Buy protection plans...the item either won't need it or already has as an acceptable manufacturer's warranty.",1

From bunkhouse style sleeping to ocean-facing suites, there's something for every budget. RV spaces for rent, too. Really liked having a fridge to use in the little kitchenette area by the front desk. The community laptop and TV were great too! Meeting other guests was entertaining. My son & I had a good time staying there while we waited for our condo to be finished! Suggestion: try to move to Homer in early SUMMER. February just ain't ever gonna be REALLLLY fun! But the Driftwood Inn staff sure made our stay 100x better with their courtesy and acts of sheer kindness! Thanks for helping get my kiddo onto the bus every day with a smile on his face.",1

Went there for an issue with my 3 month old Samsung Galaxy S9+ it won't do a software update at all. So I spoke with Raymond who informed me we are in Alaska and I would have to call AT&T. This guy is a complete idiot and should not be working in customer service or in any technology company.,1

A visit to the actual Alaskan Brewery in Juneau. Good news is you get to sample the beers. Bad news is there is no Brewery tour. Shame. It also sells a selection of merchandise. There is one IPA that is not available anywhere else so worth a trip to sample that.,1
"I ate at this place the end of June and had the ribs. The ribs were indeed good, but I will not be going back for two reasons: 1. The place was very loud. They have nothing in there to absorb sound and so it was very hard to hear my companions. I didnâ€™t expect to hear a pin drop, but this place was VERY loud and clattery. 2. I was shocked that not a single employee in the place was wearing a mask or gloves during a pandemic with Alaskaâ€™s numbers on the rise. The tables were only normally spaced, there were no partitions, and the bar was in the middle of the action, also not partitioned and no one wearing a mask. This was a huge problem for me. Indeed, I was literally the ONLY person in there wearing a mask, as far as I could tell. Which I thought was very strange at the time. I have since read that this place subscribes to the anti-masker nonsense, which tells me they do not give a damn about my health. I have read social media posts implying that their uncaring attitude toward my health is some sort of misguided attempt at patriotism, but I do not go out to eat to display patriotism. I go out to eat to enjoy a meal in a pleasant, but most of all SAFE environment. And if they donâ€™t care about my health regarding masks and gloves, I can only speculate on food safety and how their relationship with the health department is gonna go. Are they going to protest pesky government regulations there too? Fortunately, there are other places to eat ribs in town that are just as good. I will be frequenting them instead.",1
"ALASKA Christians: STOP BURYING YOUR TALENTS Dear Christian, Proposition 1 has failed. It failed because the enemies of God were more motivated to its defeat than the children of God were to its victory. It is no more complicated than that. However, that is not the only failure in Alaska that can be accredited to a lack of motivation and action by Christians, by far. The government has just released statistics showing Alaska as number 1 in the nation in per capita rates of violent crime. Alaska has been number 1 in suicides for some time and is number 4 in property crimes and in the top 10 of alcoholism rates. Alaska is a very dark place spiritually speaking and a large part of that is precisely because Christians are failing to take the light of Jesus Christ into the darkness of the culture here. Martin Luther King one said, â€œAnd it may come to pass that the greatest tragedy of our time will not be the words and deeds of the children of darkness but the silence and apathy of the children of light.â€ Brethren, this ought not to be so. It should not be that the neighbors around your church only get paid personal visits from the cults like Mormons and Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses. It should not be that Christians hold the light of Christ only within the four walls of a building. It should not be that churches send missionaries halfway around the world but not across the street from their own building. It should not be that the soldiers of Christ try to fight a spiritual war from the comfort of their foxholes. Jesus said that His church would prevail against the gates of Hell. Where are the courageous souls willing to charge those gates with the sword of God? Brethren , it is beyond past time for the church to arise out of its pews and start preaching in the darkest areas of our culture. It is beyond past time to confront the enemies of Christ on the battlefield of our state. If you are not motivated to go out and do battle on the battlefield then eventually the Devil will bring the battle to the altar of your church and your front door. At that point it will be too late. I beseech you as a fellow child of God to please answer the call of the shofar. To hear the trumpet blast of war. Too many battles have already been lost. Let us not lose the war for our nation. We do injustice to the men in uniform who fought for this nation and we do an injustice to the Cross of Christ that fought for our souls if we sit idly by in the comfort of our churches and refuse to go into the highways and byways and plead with the lost to come to the wedding. The church is not a building. The church is people and we are losing people every day to the enemy and most Christians just sing louder in their services to drown out the mournful cries of a lost and dying world. Let not your congregation be counted among the cowards, Brethren. Call the troops to battle. Sharpen their swords. Equip the saints for the preaching of the Gospel and then unleash the saints of heaven against the forces of Hell. Invade the streets of Anchorage with the Gospel of Christ. I pray that you hear this one voice crying in the wilderness. May God be with you. Pastor David Grisham Repent Alaska",1
"Ate here a number of years ago and the ramen was absolutely delicious. Love how the interior design of the restaurant is focused on creating a Japanese-focused environment.

"Relaxed, cozy spot in downtown Anchorage to enjoy an espresso drink and soup, a sandwich, or maybe a pastry. They do a great job with their K-Bay roasted coffee and it often includes latte art, which is a nice touch. Sports gear is available for check out near the counter for those who are heading upstairs to The Rooftop. They have a changing installation of local art, photography, and things of that nature. Unfortunately, it's often chilly here in winter due to the position of their doors. Seating isn't comfy or cooshy, just hard chairs and benches. This isn't a problem, but is definitely worth knowing if you were thinking about coming to settle in for a bit with a laptop or whatever.",1
I was Able to get a Screen Protector for my iPhone X and they installed it for me as well...that's pretty nice considering it's always a Given that You'll get Air Bubbles or Not Alling it correctly.,1

What a horrible bartender. She threw everyone out of the restaurant with 5 minutes to go in the biggest Seahawks game of the year and locked the door with an entire plane load of people wanting to get in because she wanted to go home instead of waiting 6 more minutes and making more money. She wouldn't even let my mother stay and watch the end of the game while she closed up. Unbelievable. I've never seen anything like it. She must be a former or future government bureaucrat.,1

"The front desk person was helpful. If you are on the prepaid plans and bought your phone or sum elsewhere (ie walmart or big box store) they aren't empowered to do much with your account unless you've called the national customer service people and updated all your info. Even still, the manager was more than apologetic and still quite helpful at easing the unfortunate news. I didn't have to purchase a new sym, which is awesome!

Dark Horse sits between the Denaina Convention Center, City Hall and the Robert Atwood Building, so they are always busy.

They also offer french press and tea pots for only $7, so it is easy to enjoy an extended morning stay while you read one of their complimentary Anchorage Daily News papers. What I love most though, everyone is treated with respect here. Iâ€™ve know a few people between homes and jobs who might not have been welcomed in other establishments but are able to spend time out of the cold, enjoying a cup of coffee and a friendly game of cards (or one of the other games they have for customers to use).

While the spicy chicken sandwich only takes seconds to complete the frosty chocolate shake could be out-of-order or take a minute or two to finish.

"Definitely not a consignment shop with an attention to detail. Math and money are always in their favor, they play games with paying congsignors. The old â€œcheck is in the mail routineâ€. Last payment I received was for $8 after they took out $8 for Craigslist ad fees. Never was discussed or mentioned that they would take fees from consignors for Craigslist ads. I post on Craigslist for free anyway. Had items sit in their showroom for a year with no price tags on them. Every time I had a concern or comment it was rebuffed with immediate excuses and rationalization of how things are done. I felt ripped off after consigning here. Constantly given the run around and have to stop back repeatedly to resolve anything. Iâ€™d recommend another place or just sell on Craigslist as I did. Family run operation with family social politics and inefficiency. They have zero regard for consignors unless youâ€™re selling bigger ticket items that make them more money. Consigning smaller items puts you on the pay no mind list. Donâ€™t expect to get any respectable pay for your items. They have to many mouths to feed under their business model and it comes out of the consignors cut. I tried supporting Local and regret it due to their unprofessional business practices. Try talking you into using store credit so they donâ€™t have to make payouts plus then they sell more items from their shop. Iâ€™m just not a fan of the games they play and how they run a business. They will not adapt or change tactics despite multiple customer complaints. Good luck",1

We had seen them a couple of times for various reasons because they are understanding and not as expensive as some of the other vets in town. Recently one of my sister in laws guinea took a turn for the worst. After months of x-rays to see how he was fairing on his new meds we got heartbreaking news that he would possibly need surgery. After a long thought he was taken in for 1 more xray. He's in hospice care now. The vet at Chena vet consulted other vets. She looked other cases up and she couldn't find how to fix him. She suggested we not do surgery. You can tell the people here really love animals and want nothing more then them to be healthy. This means so much to me and we will be back anytime our pets need care. Great vets and great level of care.,1

"Unfortunately, Denali Park is expensive to visit. You can see the first 15 miles for free; however, there isn't much to see in that area. But to see the real sights along the rest of the 80 mile road you have to buy a bus ticket which range from $50 to over $100. The good news is that kids age 15 and under are free. Plan ahead because visiting the park is an all-day affair. Bring your own food and water on the bus. There are no snack shops in the park. Latrines are at most rest stops. The buses leave early in the morning and are gone for 8 to 12 hours. Get reserve seats because the buses sell out. Then prepare to be amazed at the vastness of Denali's grandure and open spaces. Keep your eyes peeled for the wildlife which are in river valleys, in the sky and behind a tree. If luck is with you, the clouds will clear and you will have a view of spectacular Mount Denali from several regions of the park. If you do get a clear view, snap a photo right then because the clouds can close back in within minutes and stay the rest of the day. There are too many breath-taking vistas to count. Geology buffs will love the diverse formations laid bare to the eyes for all to marvel. I would give it more stars if the costs were lower and the park had flushing toilets in more places.",1
"Spectacular views, drive, hiking trails!! Watch out for Moose if you chose to hike, follow the guidelines of Nature Center;In case you encounter wild life. Paradise for bird photographers. There's this 30 mile drive from visitor Center into the park preserve. I could spot fewer species of birds. Watch out for weather news before planning this trip.",1

"MC Hough is a great get-away from Anchorage- beautiful and wild. I often brought my son Aidan here when he was little. It was our favorite place to go nearest the City. However, over the years from so much use and abuse, there has been a lot of damage to the trees and other vegetation. ""Compaction"" as State Parks calls it, from so many happy feet visiting virtual wilderness, compacts the soil around the roots of trees which exposes their roots. Then the trees die and blow over in the wind. Then more trees are exposed and blow down. This is a cascading effect. Then forest fires rage through as natures way of clearing the debris and restoring the forest. Mc Hough Creek is A GREAT place to begin UNPRECEDENTED collaboration between Alaska State Parks, Chugach National Forest and those who know and love Mc Hough Creek and Forest. This collaboration is a way for people and government to work together for virtual benefit. Otherwise, Mc Hough Creek may continue to become more and more degraded.",1
Wow - wandered in here on a visit from Fairbanks. Great conversations with friendly people about politics,1
family owned place the menus look like news papers .. Food not consistent but decent,1

"Is local government, what can I say",1
"Every time i ask what my balance is over the phone, the people here ALWAYS tell me the wrong number. I was approved for a $600 loan twice. No prob. Both paid on time every time One day I was trying for same thing right after TRUMP won election & i said I voted for him. Not approved for same amount or lower since. Wow. I mean, i saw the excitement leave the person's face as they shook a little like a transformation. Then rudeness after. Kind of a spectacle now that I think about it. LOL. Werewolf tellers that change when hearing Pro-Trump talk. Scared me a little though. I didn't wanna get bite & infected like a zombie or become one of them. I enjoy my freedom. That's why I live in Alaska. I Just need a better more modern bank I guess. Stay away from this bank. Werewolves zombies work here. Hate to see what would of happened if I wore a MAGA hat.",1

Second time happened that after ordering pizza online through their site, a few days later someone from ALBANIA tried to run our card (to buy something from Globe.com.al Albanian site) first for $1000, and second time for $200!!! Good thing our bank blocked these charges!!! Its a total scam and they save card numbers and run them later!

The best pizza in Government Hill,1
"The service was great, the only part I had trouble with was there menus are all digital so you have to take a picture of their QR code and get the menu through your phone if you have an iPhone it's easy but if you have an Android with no QR reader it's a slight pain in the rear. But the food was great and they respect the 6-ft distance for Covid. My experience for the place overall was wonderful I rarely go to more spend your places, but if you have the money and want to a nice treat I recommend Spenard Roadhouse.",1
Seems like the most expensive Carr's in town and it's in the poorest part of town. To me that just shows they are after that government money.

"I came here needing help repairing my iPhone. A young boy(appeared to be the owners child possibly?) showed me their options for buying a used iPhone(which were rather steeply priced) and when I explained my situation- he continued to show me the phones for sale, but no other options were discussed and no other employees were available to help me. I essentially received no help and no service during my visit here.",1
"Headed in for my first forest fair in years, super excited to see all the new vendors, meet cool people and see what the bier garden is all about. Unfortunately the have massively outgrown their space and are in need of a new location. (Or frankly, less vendors) The bier garden -requires- you to purchase a $7 stainless steel cup, plus the $6 beer to drink. They then expect you to -reuse- this cup for any further drinks, which is a serious health code violation. There are signs up and down the alyeska highway stating ""no politics, no religion, and no dogs."" The latter they could promise, but there was a man standing in the middle of the fair holding an umbrella about ""fearing the lord"" and trying to pass out pamphlets about his religion. I dont care what kind of court case was had to let him in, but security had no problem with him prancing around. Dont think ill be going back anytime soon. Not a summer day I enjoyed. The magic of the fair is lost, and is just a consumer market. Please do better",1
"Depends on who you get phallic-wise, other than that super-duper helpful. If you are just going in for test, get your paper and go to information desk. Always quick turn around for test. I have been in records, testing, and main lobby quite a few times. Lobby will be fair wait regardless, but plenty of time to have a conversation or read a book and before you know it your number is up. My only advice pertaining to the lobby is go when everyone else is at work, significantly more parking spots and astoundingly less waiting. Working weekends are handy when you need to work with government agencies.",1
"Awesome store, although their some of their apparels are but expensive compare to the other store, but their guns??? They have it all kinds and cheaper compare to other stores. Right now, some of the gums that I want to purchase are temporarily sold out. Maybe due to election time...",1
"I'm very torn in writing this review. Black Cup serves some of the best coffee in town, but I struggle to get past the shortcomings of the location itself. On my last several visits, the common areas have been exceptionally unclean. The floors appear to have not been swept or mopped in days, and my backpack has stains to prove it. I did not look closely at the food and coffee preparation areas, but hopefully they are better maintained. The ceiling was dripping water onto my table, barely missing my laptop. When I informed the staff, they replied that they were aware but had no plans to fix the leak. One of the two bathrooms had a broken toilet that would not flush, and unfortunately one or more previous occupants had found out too late in their visit... Until the proprietors make some much-needed repairs and institute better cleanliness standards, I do not plan to revisit Black Cup.",1
Too much politics,1
"3 stars for awesome live music, 0 for service, Iâ€™ve seen way too many people way over served here, bartenders are supposed to be trained in knowing when to cut people off. Theyâ€™re not.

Truly impressive facility. Great location. They were setting up a large Magic tournament in the back while we were there. They had an X-men comic my son had been seeking at a very good price.

"ALASKA Christians: STOP BURYING YOUR TALENTS Dear Christian, Proposition 1 has failed. It failed because the enemies of God were more motivated to its defeat than the children of God were to its victory. It is no more complicated than that. However, that is not the only failure in Alaska that can be accredited to a lack of motivation and action by Christians, by far. The government has just released statistics showing Alaska as number 1 in the nation in per capita rates of violent crime. Alaska has been number 1 in suicides for some time and is number 4 in property crimes and in the top 10 of alcoholism rates. Alaska is a very dark place spiritually speaking and a large part of that is precisely because Christians are failing to take the light of Jesus Christ into the darkness of the culture here. Martin Luther King one said, â€œAnd it may come to pass that the greatest tragedy of our time will not be the words and deeds of the children of darkness but the silence and apathy of the children of light.â€ Brethren, this ought not to be so. It should not be that the neighbors around your church only get paid personal visits from the cults like Mormons and Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses. It should not be that Christians hold the light of Christ only within the four walls of a building. It should not be that churches send missionaries halfway around the world but not across the street from their own building. It should not be that the soldiers of Christ try to fight a spiritual war from the comfort of their foxholes. Jesus said that His church would prevail against the gates of Hell. Where are the courageous souls willing to charge those gates with the sword of God? Brethren , it is beyond past time for the church to arise out of its pews and start preaching in the darkest areas of our culture. It is beyond past time to confront the enemies of Christ on the battlefield of our state. If you are not motivated to go out and do battle on the battlefield then eventually the Devil will bring the battle to the altar of your church and your front door. At that point it will be too late. I beseech you as a fellow child of God to please answer the call of the shofar. To hear the trumpet blast of war. Too many battles have already been lost. Let us not lose the war for our nation. We do injustice to the men in uniform who fought for this nation and we do an injustice to the Cross of Christ that fought for our souls if we sit idly by in the comfort of our churches and refuse to go into the highways and byways and plead with the lost to come to the wedding. The church is not a building. The church is people and we are losing people every day to the enemy and most Christians just sing louder in their services to drown out the mournful cries of a lost and dying world. Let not your congregation be counted among the cowards, Brethren. Call the troops to battle. Sharpen their swords. Equip the saints for the preaching of the Gospel and then unleash the saints of heaven against the forces of Hell. Invade the streets of Anchorage with the Gospel of Christ. I pray that you hear this one voice crying in the wilderness. May God be with you. Pastor David Grisham Repent Alaska",1

Freshly made mexican food in a quaint spot on government hill.,1
I walked into this store today intending on buying a new laptop. The man at the counter was very rude and had and attitude. I explained what I was looking for and said.... you can look around... offering no help or assistance. I walked out. No sale for him and I'll never be back here again as this is the second time that I have been to this store with the same crappie experience.,1

They even gave me extra advice on the house we were looking to buy. Overall a great service by a great local company.

"Absolutely awesome service. I needed title work done and the process was a little longer than at the DMV because they had to get the state's approval for lost title etc.. Their service includes the agent there filling out forms for you and all I needed to do was sign and date. Of course they charge a fee for their service, more than the dmv, but it's completely worth it. The wait time was no longer than 15 minutes. I got my title printed right there half hour later and after paying, was on my jolly way. The staff are all very helpful and I never once felt a reason to bring out ""the Karen"". These wonderful people will take any form of payment (card/cash). No bitcoin yet! Slow down! Anyway, would I go here again? Absolutely! Would I recommend others to go here? Definitely! Would I give them a great review? In a heartbeat! I'm pretty level headed about reviews and only give more than four stars if I can't think of any way for a business to improve.",1

Kick back in the dining room with family and friends, or bring a party to the upstairs party room. We always buy pies from here for the holidays, Nancy (the owner) makes all of their baked goods by hand, and will make just about any custom pie you could ask for, and many of them in sugar free!",1
"If you like history this Museum tells the history of Valdez before the US government Force the entire town to completely move to a new location The museum has lots of miscellaneous items from the era, but is the dioramas in the glass cases showing the entire area before the move that are the highlight of this Museum. Lots of detail, and a real nice reconstruction of how things used to be. The museum is the only way you'll see this as there's nothing left of the original Town whatsoever. He only had 20 minutes to spend and needed more like an hour and a half at least. This is one of those gems put up by locals that are the Highlight for people interested in history.",1
"Love this place and our dogs love it too! There's a large, open field and about a 1 mile loop around a small lake that are both off-leash. The terrain is uneven most of the way, if that's a factor. There are no completely fenced in areas and multiple trails feed into the loop all the way around so bring a leash if your dog has a tendency to wander too far away. The lake water is accessible at many points along the walk, which our 2 love, but pay attention to recent news and signs posted for moose, bears, aggressive beavers and water-borne pathogens.",1

I paid a $28 pet fee and then was asked if I would be the only person occupying the room. I said no I booked online for 2 adults and staff said he cannot know for sure that i did and it would be $5.60 for my guest that would also need to provide a photo ID. At this point I asked for a refund which I was told wasnt possible bc I purchased online! Worst experience I've ever had dealing with front desk staff at a hotel",1

If you don't want to honor the Nationally advertised prices then don't advertise nationally, don't have it on your menu, leave the state altogether. The right thing to do would be honor the Nationally broadcast special price. By the way I did buy it, but assure you I won't in the future. The steak bits lacked any flavor from seasoning.",1

"The Midtown Mall has had a serious overhaul in recent years and has so much to offer. After losing Sears to downsizing and the grocery store as well, the mall quieted quite a bit. But then Nordstrom Rack, Steamdot, Burger-Fi and other niche shops started to fill in empty storefront. When REI and Carrâ€™s Safeway announced projects, it was clear this was a long time commercial area that was going to overcome issues and revitalize itself. An REI like this should not be allowed to exist though...it is so enormous and engaging that it can easily make you forget there are other things to do in life beyond looking at sleeping bags for temperature ratings. With our downtown Nordstrom closed, Nordstrom Rack has become one of the stand out stores for clothes shopping in Anchorage. The deals are great. All of the shops are excellent and worth visiting. While the food court has closed due to COVID, everything else is open. They have also become an early voting location during this election cycle. Canâ€™t think of a better place to wait in line.",1
"In the past, I've received excellent customer service. In this case however the reception person was completely rude, did not listen, was dismissive and interrupted each sentence that the person I was with and myself attempted to make. She was a horrible reception person and really shouldn't be in that position... With her General attitude and demeanor, I'm not sure she should be in any professional position without extensive customer service training. Learning the art of listening would be greatly beneficial to her and anyone - and I mean anyone professionally or personally - who has the opportunity to talk with her. Her name was Kayla. I found her services to be far below stellar and her attitude completely inappropriate rude and dismissive I tried to explain a very simple concept which she interrupted and said this is totally different and I had not yet even finished what I was about to say and when I try to say something further the person I was with said she's not listening to you. She interrupted the person I was with him said oh I am listening I just had to do this this in this. Unbelievably rude, unbelievably opinionated and arrogant. I've never had such a bad experience at GCI in my life. Normally their employees are incredibly competent both in person and over the telephone. This Kayla should not be working at the front desk or in any position without extreme and extensive customer service training. Learning the art of shutting her mouth when somebody else is speaking, especially a customer, would greatly benefit her. It would greatly benefit anyone around here. As I said earlier, this was a very negative experience and Kayla was the cause of it. What we were asking about she made sound impossible which was far from impossible. She also used the term iOS in a way to make yourself look smarter and confuse the person I was with. I had to actually say to the other person she's talking about an iPhone. I got the impression she like to Bandy a term about to make yourself seem smarter than she was and to confuse the general customer. The person I was with an I left completely dissatisfied and rather upset by her supposed customer service skills. She realized just how badly she had behaved and tried to backpedal and be a little bit more friendly when she realized that we would probably report her to a supervisor. It was painfully obvious, transparent and really quite the satisfying.",1

Hours vary - however, if they have enough people to last till quittin' time, they lock the doors. No ""Last Minute Larry's"" here!",1

Worst customer service ever. Stepfather just recently passed away. We dont know the password to get into his laptop. We talked to Geek Squad on the phone. They didn't help so they told us to go into the store. Made an appointment and they would not help us because we wouldn't wear a mask. They were unreasonable.,1
"I'm very torn in writing this review. Black Cup serves some of the best coffee in town, but I struggle to get past the shortcomings of the location itself. On my last several visits, the common areas have been exceptionally unclean. The floors appear to have not been swept or mopped in days, and my backpack has stains to prove it. I did not look closely at the food and coffee preparation areas, but hopefully they are better maintained. The ceiling was dripping water onto my table, barely missing my laptop. When I informed the staff, they replied that they were aware but had no plans to fix the leak. One of the two bathrooms had a broken toilet that would not flush, and unfortunately one or more previous occupants had found out too late in their visit... Until the proprietors make some much-needed repairs and institute better cleanliness standards, I do not plan to revisit Black Cup.",1
"This hotel doesn't even deserve the one star I had to give to be able to post this review! I booked online with Hotels.com for 2 adults and when arriving to the hotel I was informed that the room I'd booked wasn't actually available but they could ""upgrade"" me to a double queen which at the time I didnt care as I just wanted to get in and relax. I paid a $28 pet fee and then was asked if I would be the only person occupying the room. I said no I booked online for 2 adults and staff said he cannot know for sure that i did and it would be $5.60 for my guest that would also need to provide a photo ID. At this point I asked for a refund which I was told wasnt possible bc I purchased online! Worst experience I've ever had dealing with front desk staff at a hotel",1
They decided they wanted to mix politics and food on an official Facebook page so gotta take back four of my stars.,1
"Horrible staff! I was told I'd have to get a new iphone or Samsung, that I couldn't use my Google Pixel 4XL on the network.",1
"Wow, what a historic social project during the depression! I never heard of this ""new town"" experiment. I'm glad we had such a well spoken tour guide to relate his growing up in the settlement. I would definitely recommend you take the time to read all the displays about literally starting a community from scratch, organized by our federal government in Washington. 40 percent of the first 200 families remained in place after 10 years. Other families took the place of many who left. Today the community boasts 7,200 people.",1
Wonderful customer service and great food! I really wanted to try birria tacos and thankfully I saw on their Facebook that they had them. The food was really yummy and definitely the best birria tacos I've had yet. I ordered on their website instead of Doordash and it was a great decision - got 10% off since it was my first order. I will for sure be ordering from them again soon!,1
The south viewpoint is far better than the north - it gives your sweeping views up the river which creates dramatic depth when shooting photos of the mountain. The grounds seem to be better maintained also with plenty of information and binoculars to observe the surrounds. Make sure you have a good zoom on your camera because youâ€™re still a bit too far for your iPhone camera to be effective,1
Left my laptop computer at the Covid 19 check point. Got a call from someone named Charlie that security has my pc...nice guy A++++,1
The place was shut down because of the government shutdown. We still had an awesome time here. Did the trails and drove into the park. If you want to come you should it's open and the snow plow is clearing the roads in the park...,1
"In the past, I've received excellent customer service. In this case however the reception person was completely rude, did not listen, was dismissive and interrupted each sentence that the person I was with and myself attempted to make. She was a horrible reception person and really shouldn't be in that position... With her General attitude and demeanor, I'm not sure she should be in any professional position without extensive customer service training. Learning the art of listening would be greatly beneficial to her and anyone - and I mean anyone professionally or personally - who has the opportunity to talk with her. Her name was Kayla. I found her services to be far below stellar and her attitude completely inappropriate rude and dismissive I tried to explain a very simple concept which she interrupted and said this is totally different and I had not yet even finished what I was about to say and when I try to say something further the person I was with said she's not listening to you. She interrupted the person I was with him said oh I am listening I just had to do this this in this. Unbelievably rude, unbelievably opinionated and arrogant. I've never had such a bad experience at GCI in my life. Normally their employees are incredibly competent both in person and over the telephone. This Kayla should not be working at the front desk or in any position without extreme and extensive customer service training. Learning the art of shutting her mouth when somebody else is speaking, especially a customer, would greatly benefit her. It would greatly benefit anyone around here. As I said earlier, this was a very negative experience and Kayla was the cause of it. What we were asking about she made sound impossible which was far from impossible. She also used the term iOS in a way to make yourself look smarter and confuse the person I was with. I had to actually say to the other person she's talking about an iPhone. I got the impression she like to Bandy a term about to make yourself seem smarter than she was and to confuse the general customer. The person I was with an I left completely dissatisfied and rather upset by her supposed customer service skills. She realized just how badly she had behaved and tried to backpedal and be a little bit more friendly when she realized that we would probably report her to a supervisor. It was painfully obvious, transparent and really quite the satisfying.",1
I enjoy shopping at the Good News Bible book store so much I was shopping there once a month before I left town on my vacation and now that I'm back I'm looking forward to shopping more soon.,1
"Every time i ask what my balance is over the phone, the people here ALWAYS tell me the wrong number. I was approved for a $600 loan twice. No prob. Both paid on time every time One day I was trying for same thing right after TRUMP won election & i said I voted for him. Not approved for same amount or lower since. Wow. I mean, i saw the excitement leave the person's face as they shook a little like a transformation. Then rudeness after. Kind of a spectacle now that I think about it. LOL. Werewolf tellers that change when hearing Pro-Trump talk. Scared me a little though. I didn't wanna get bite & infected like a zombie or become one of them. I enjoy my freedom. That's why I live in Alaska. I Just need a better more modern bank I guess. Stay away from this bank. Werewolves zombies work here. Hate to see what would of happened if I wore a MAGA hat.",1
"Small no nonsense place, Google says there is kareokee there, but that is not true. Contrary to what conversations the name of the place would prompt, conversation about religion and politics is not allowed. ""For Alaska"" it's a nice place.",1
"Great food, good service, and if you dine in they have one America news on",1
"When I was there they only had two beer options and neither of them were amazing. The good news is that they are always making new batches, so the next you go, it will be completely different. The atmosphere is like a coffee shop, except with beer. No food. Just a great place to hang out.",1
Too much politics,1
"The location is horrific. Many of their patients are elderly, disabled, or just don't see well (DUH). It is a nightmare to get to, a nightmare to park (their lot is completely inadequate), and staff is often rude or just plain nasty. My husband only goes here because he is trapped in the VA system and this practice is the one they refer to, probably because they have an ex-military doctor here that knows the government ropes. This practice has been here since 1972 when downtown was still an OK destination and gentrification began. Wake up people, this location means dealing with street people, and the jail is just down the street. It is at the foot of a MONSTROUS hill that is impossible to drive up in the winter, and to avoid it you have to go to the worst area in Anchorage, by the homeless shelter and Bean's Cafe. Time for them to move to midtown for their clientele. Just plain UNSAFE to go here.",1
Great helpful service. Got my new Samsung j7 with my life line. When your just starting out it's a real help thanks guys,1
"Batteryplus screen repair is a good deal, if you schedule your appointment online. I got my iPhone SE screen replaced for 80 bucks.",1
"Good food, better during the day than at night for some reason, also the employees do not know how to use their ipay and samsung pay on their payment system. They need to be trained by someone who knows....they get that down and i give them five stars",1
"The morning of Friday March 25 2021 about 7 or 8 am. An elder 58yr went in to eat some breakfast drink some coffee read the news paper at the cookie jar. The staff brought him to a table, so he waited for a menu Well others came in and they were seated with menus. Eventually Their meals showed up. So the Elder attempted to ask one of staff about a menu, the staff walked pass and continued to Ignore him. So after the other customers Finished with their meal he decided to get up and leave. That's a sad way to treat your elders. Majority of Fairbanks restaurants take care of their elders.Please help us bring attention to the situation by either pressing the like or any other action on this comment. No Elder should go through this. Thank you for taking the time to read this",1
Thank God for theses people and our American government,1
Version is where you what to finance a phone Samsung S21 deals check your deals when u go in please you will get straight forward payments,1
Very helpful. My wife and I both changed cell phone service to GCI and got new phones. Friendly knowledgeable staff walked us through the GCI system to make sure we could get the best use of our new Samsung phones. We highly recommend the Soldotna Alaska store.,1
"Great staff, amazing selection. Usually have a election to rival the warehouse",1
"I have made pilgrimages to this place for years. Unfortunately I get a dose of politics I don't like whenever I visit anymore. Sell me cards, don't preach socialism, and I'll keep spending my capitalist dollars.",1
Seems to be well staffed however they had several people off that day I was told. I was serviced in a reasonable amount of time. I looked around the store for phones and tablets selection. They have a lot of Apple but not much of an Android selection at all ..,1
"The employees are friendly, fairly knowledgeable, and even though the reps aren't trained as technicians for phone repairs they try to help. If you are having technical difficultly I would suggest going to either apple or best buys Samsung guy because they can fix your issue. This att store is always clean but can be crowded with people, so be patient it's worth the wait.",1
I was Able to get a Screen Protector for my iPhone X and they installed it for me as well...that's pretty nice considering it's always a Given that You'll get Air Bubbles or Not Alling it correctly.,1

Good movie. Lady on laptop the whole time. Husband on phone! So much for following the rules.,1
"We dined at this new restaurant because of a review I read in the Anchorage Daily News (by Mara Severin, Dec 28, 2018), which was glowing on the verge of ecstasy. And our experience was much the same. Whether you are an avid foodie (Tres Amigos Tacos) or looking for a comfortable, filling meal (Kimchi Tots), you won't be disappointed. The selections are a truly serendipitous find in a town where almost every restaurant hypes the same old bland, boring menu--as if! The combinations of taste were new and delightful; but most importantly, everything we ate was cooked perfectly and served hot out of the kitchen. I was reminded of my all-time favorite restaurant, Asia de Cuba. And while, of course, the menu and presentation at Seoul Casa is very different, it now rates #2 on my list for originality and aptitude. (For another surprise, ask where the chef learned to cook.) You add your own heat, so great for kids and wimps like me. Great for date night because the food itself is a conversation piece. Friendly wait staff who appreciate both the foodie and the simply hungry. Prices are very reasonable considering how much you get. Don't be put off by the spare and somewhat confusing dining room when you step inside. Just sit right down and prepare to be delighted.",1
"If you want a spicy chicken sandwich and a frosty chocolate shake then you need to stop by Wendy's before you drive home. This Wendy's is a great location for those of you that commute to the valley, but the 5th Ave traffic is horrible. At peak times (4-5 PM) the drive-thru is completely full, so park and go inside. While the spicy chicken sandwich only takes seconds to complete the frosty chocolate shake could be out-of-order or take a minute or two to finish. The dinning area is relaxing with a television to watch the news.",1

"Best products, prices, and support in Consumer 'lectronics !! I bought a small Asus laptop from them that burned out at 12 months .( Possible malware) When their tech support and Asus Co. couldn't repair it they immediately replaced it with a new next gen upgrade and restarted the 12 month ((included) warranty. ðŸ’™ These Folks !!",1
"Remodeled inside, very nice, warm, power outlets throughout to work with your laptop. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was inside. For a fast food restaurant, very upscale.",1
"Quiet, plenty of places to plug in a laptop or charge your phone.",1
Came in to buy a $1300 laptop and attempted to get help from several different sales associates.I waited 45 minutes for assistance and nobody helped. I guess I'm taking my money elsewhere.,1
"DO NOT ORDER ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!! Second time happened that after ordering pizza online through their site, a few days later someone from ALBANIA tried to run our card (to buy something from Globe.com.al Albanian site) first for $1000, and second time for $200!!! Good thing our bank blocked these charges!!! Its a total scam and they save card numbers and run them later! If you want their pizza, order over the phone and ask for the %20 online discount, but dont trust their site!!",1

I am currently in the market for a laptop but don't know the first thing about them and David was so informative and helpful. He made me feel righr at home and it felt like talking to a friend.

The did a quick and very good job on my laptop that I was sure was ready for the garbage. 1st time I've used them and will definitely use them again and have told my friends how great and friendly they are there. I'm tech challenged and they talked to me so I understood without feeling stupid.. Thanks y'all!,0
"This review is for service. Sales could be different, I haven't dealt with them. I am the foreman at a shop near AKsales. I had a Cadillac with a bad Body Control Module. After replacement it will need to be reprogrammed. I replaced the module and took the car to AKsales for the reprogramming and was informed that it would cost $155 and some change, and if the programming failed I would still be charged for their time. I agreed and left. Several days later they called and said that they programmed the BCM, but now the car wouldn't start. I asked if the had reinitialized the immobilizer for BCM replacement. They assured me that they had and the car had another issue. I doubted this because it ran fine with the old BCM it just didn't have backup camera or taillights. I ordered equipment to program GM modules and went to get the car. when I get to the service department I was suprised to find that my bill was suddenly $210. thats right, not only where they unable to program the BCM they wanted more money for failing. after a short talk they agreed that the amount we had agreed on was probably the price that should be paid, so I payed the $155, took the car and left. when I got back to my shop I hooked up the Jbox and laptop and found that they did properly program the BCM, so I went back and selected immobilizer and hit ""re initialize for BCM replacement."" the car started. Just one simple step that took me 10 minutes. I am an experienced mechanic, but I have never had GM training. why could a GM trained tech not do this? So, long story short. If I as an experienced mechanic took a car there for a very simple task, and not only was the task not completed, but they tried to charge me MORE for not completing the task. How comfortable are you bringing your car to them for service?",0
"If you're in downtown Anchorage and you're looking for fine dining then you can't beat Orso. The Orso signature dish is the Orso Lamb Shank. The Orso Lamb Shank is the only entree that has never been removed from the menu since the opening of the restaurant in May 2000. Our server Sharay S. was absolutely excellent! I suggest asking for her table on your next visit. The Orso restaurant (6,000 sq. ft) contains two floors that seat 190 people with a bar on the first floor. The second floor is often reserved for private parties, however also used for public seating. The restrooms are on the first floor behind the stairs. I've been told the women's restroom has heated seats. Orso (Italian for ""Bear""), also known as ""Ristorante Orso"" was developed by Glacier BrewHouse owners Chris Anderson and Bob Acree in 1999 according to the article written by Melissa Devaughn, Alaska Daily News, Sept. 15, 2000. Ristorante Orso officially opened in late May 2000. The former occupants of the property was the Imaginarium. If this review was helpful please click the Like button. May 2019 (1) Harvest Salad: $8.95 (1) Panzanella Salad: $7.95 (1) Crab Stuffed Alaska Rockfish: $25.95 (1) Orso Lamb Shank: $34.50 (1) Orso Ale Blonde: $6.50 Tax: $0.00",3

"In addition to running more than two hours over schedule the captain talked nonstop passing a lot of incorrect or extemporaneous information. He clearly hates millennials, does not believe in climate change and thinks the government of Valdez is corrupt. The scenery of Prince William Sound was incredible or else this would be a 1 star review. I do not recommend this tour. Call Stan Stephens for your tour needs in Valdez. Not enough indoor seating for inclement weather. His crew was fantastic. I don't know how they put up with Fred's verbal diarrhea day after day .",0

"3 stars for awesome live music, 0 for service, Iâ€™ve seen way too many people way over served here, bartenders are supposed to be trained in knowing when to cut people off. Theyâ€™re not. Anchorage is cracking down on over servering, and over indulging, also a reacuring theme here. Heads up! Soon to be in the news for bartenders and patron arrests.",0
Great helpful service. Got my new Samsung j7 with my life line. When your just starting out it's a real help thanks guys,0
This is the 2nd store I've called in Anchorage about their new wings which have been being talked about on social media and news outlets. Apparently they are not doing the new wings which are supposed to be 10 for 7.99. Update: called back and was told to contact the franchise owner Ian ianhurd@dominosalaska.com to figure what's going on. So if anyone has future issues with food quality or issues in general just send an email to that address is what I was told. Would like to see these new wings in Alaska stores soon.,0
"They always have the cheapest cell phone prices, and I do my price researching pretty intensely. They also have the best sales associates! They are always knowledgable and very helpful. HOWEVER.....!! Their delivery is horrible at the Dimond store! I preordered my new Samsung Note 10+ and they kept emailing me to say my order would come in a few more weeks instead. It took so long to come in that I ended up cancelling my order, driving across town to the other store, and actually BOUGHT ONE OFF THE SHELF. The only plus in that deal was that I saved 60% of the phone's price.",0

"The library is great. Simple setting with different sections; childrens area, movies, newspapers and magazines, book series, computers to use, a study area, shelves are alphabetically and numerically organized making finding what you need more convenient. The barista in the hall is also really good, has a selection of hot beverages to choose from, I personally like the vanilla chai. They hold several different events and meetings in the theater area; movies every now and then, coucil meetings, dog shows, high school proms and balls, the saturday market. The museum is a bit basic with cultural heritage and items used by recent ancestors. It could use a few more things in there like native plants found around the area. The gift shop is a neat little area, my mom used to work there when I was young, been a while since I've taken a look in there. I do love the free books shelf when you first walk into the cultural center, along with the bulletin board of news and ads. Great place.",0
"Huge Selection, almost Bigly as Trump says it. Anything you could dream of is there waiting for you.",0
"The locals call this place ""the hallway"" because that's literally all there is. The good news is that there is a Michaels in town. The bad news is that Michaels and Safeway are the anchor stores. Otherwise, you have icing and like American Eagle to shop, which is convenient when you are talking 6 hours to the next closest mall. No food court. It's not really a mall by Lower 48 standards, but it does the job. They always do a Halloween thing for the kids, which is fun since it's freezing cold outside every October 31.",0

The terminal is under construction but still very functional. If you're arriving from out of state make sure you have filled out a covid 19 Travel Declaration online @ alaska.covidsecureapp.com. If you're not an Alaska resident you must have proof of having been tested within 72 hours before arrival. Alaska residents can get tested for free at the airport,0
"Depends on who you get phallic-wise, other than that super-duper helpful. If you are just going in for test, get your paper and go to information desk. Always quick turn around for test. I have been in records, testing, and main lobby quite a few times. Lobby will be fair wait regardless, but plenty of time to have a conversation or read a book and before you know it your number is up. My only advice pertaining to the lobby is go when everyone else is at work, significantly more parking spots and astoundingly less waiting. Working weekends are handy when you need to work with government agencies.",0
The best pizza in Government Hill,0
"Place to call home after quakes. Fri-Sun 7:30a-9-30a Early bird Breakfast $9.99, Dinner $ 16.99. M-Th Brunch 9:30a-2p $10.29, Dinner $16.99. Any news if they will put one in Wasilla? ..Would probably make a load a $$$.",0
"This place may have changed names if I recall correctly, charged my phone there after talking to the manager and after that kept feeling like my phone was getting hacked, seemed like crypto was being taken and he was providing automobiles for others, what a crazy experience. If that's the case thanks for treating the ladies right line I asked when it was happening",0

"Poor customer service tries to rip people off... He threatened someone and is extremely rude and untrustworthy. Not a good way to run business, this is peopleâ€™s hard earned money that they give you for tattoos not for you to say they were 20 minutes late coming from the valley and not be professional at the very least cmon... will never come here.

I went in before getting my oil change I asked how much it would be and how long. I was told $84.99 and be done in 10 minutes. ok Iâ€™ll get this. As I was there the guy said to get an engine cleaner. So thought ok sounds good. He asked do you need wipers? I said I think so. So he checks and says yes you need new wipers. I was like ok. After everything was done the guys tells me $178.00!!!! ðŸ˜³I look at him and said Jesus!! What are you charging me?!?! The kids reads off the prices and I was floored at the prices! I could have spent wayyyyy less on all those supplies at the store and did it myself!! Never going there again!! Nice workers but horrible prices!!,0

"Was told that with two insurances I would be completely covered. After two months received a $40 bill for just one visit. Luckily, I did not go in for all 12 visits like I was supposed to within the first month. I would have walked away with a $480 bill for the first month alone. Which does not seem so bad if I was not told I was completely covered",0

This shop is waaaaay past its prime, and is currently under liquidization and reorganization. Hours are cut to part time. This is a shop owner who would pay his employees $5/hour, if it were up to him.",3
"I have never been to a dentist that focused so much on my comfort, as well as keeping me informed about procedures and techniques.",3
"After moving here a year ago I haven't been able to bring myself to trust my head to a new stylist. I've found my new home! Go here, you won't be disappointed.",3
Never been here once and I go to this school,3
"They've got decent coffee and food, and a great play area for kids so parents can chat and enjoy their coffee while the kids are entertained. My one and only complaint with Auntie's Corner is that each time I've gone, I've never been greeted by baristas, I've always had to announce my presence before being able to order or be greeted. This morning, I came in with my daughter and a friend and her daughter. We loitered around looking at the menu and food items for a good 5 minutes before we announced ourselves and summoned a barista from somewhere unseen. The service here was much better when it was Little Miller's Cafe.",0
"Some of the most kind hearted people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing! Amazing quality of care. Knowledgeable, informative providers. I personally see Rachel Coleman, PA-C, and I trust her with my life. She is fantastic. Every single person in this office dedicates their time to doing whatever they can to helping their patients. Whether it be a refill request, answering a phone call, sending a referral, I have never been let down. I would recommend this office to anyone.",0
"I came here because I heard they are a good, christian business. They are borderline thieves. I wanted an alignment and was told I need $700+ in repairs. When I asked them to itemize the expenses I found out $150+ of the fees were for an oil change that wasn't necessary. Where are they getting this number from--the bible? I drive a subcompact. For $40 I can get a new filter and oil. The alignment itself seems decent, I just wish they hadn't tried to screw me in the process.",0
How do you want to do the customer service in this establishment is very poor it's never been consistent know they are they ever wear their own mistakes and make it seem like the,0
Never been there before but I need to go and get my sideburns done I'll tell you then and give you a more fair assessment right now at 3,3
"Usually a decent place to pickup the usual. Not a spectacular selection but local options are available. Pricing is always fair. I live nearby so often show up if I need some beer or wine. Unusual encounter earlier this evening though. For the first time ever I was met an hour before posted closing by a security employee who has never been there before that denied me entry. I am a good customer,(spent 145 today in groceries) not a vagrant and local who buys many groceries at the the Carrs as well. He immediatly denied me entry despite other shoppers inside during normal posted business hours. He was polite but stern and gave his name as Daniel. I am sure he was doing as told but I do not appreciate as a regular having a new guy tell me I cannot frequent my regular place of business. I work in customer service and would be risking my job acting in such a manor.",0
"The beer here is amazing. The company I work for did a tasting here and let's just say it was nothing short of a worthwhile experience. I am not a dark beer drinker at all...but the Zweiga Baltic Style Porter they brew is absolutely fantastic. It made my taste buds very happy...dancing with pleasure. I can't wait for this to be available by the bottle because it will become a staple in my beer fridge. The Oude Framb Was is a sour raspberry masterpiece in my opinion. While the Framb Was was tasty and sweet, the tart raspberry tang of the Oude was a refreshing taste on my pallet. The Homesteader Belgion Style Saison is a tasty brew that I can imagine enjoying after a long day of fishing. I could go on, but I will leave you with some things to explore yourself. These folks have it right and I have never been wrong.ðŸ˜…",0
"Very personable and kind staff. I haven't been a client very long but they got my kids and I in right away and they bill my insurance. One of my most favorite things about this office is that the dentist will see you out of reg hours for emergencies and as if that weren't enough reason for using their services, they also have a Keurig machine in their waiting room for you to make coffee, hot cocoa or tea with! Awesome!",0
I was the passenger so I did not go in. I was enjoying the frozen Arctic Ocean view though. Gas was not as high as I expected but I might be out of touch since I do not drive up here.,0
This is a great and friendly place. They have many of their own products and also do consignment. I have not had the opportunity to meet the owner but I have only heard good things about him. I bought this jade bracelet while I was there. It fits great and I love it. I encourage you to go experience it for yourself and I know you will find something you will love.,0
It was great! The drive in was not very promising as far as the forest and wildlife was concerned due to last year's wildfires. However I was pleasantly surprised when we got to upper skilak and I found most of the trees still intact and all of the campsites looking great. As far as the wildlife was concerned we had a black bear make an appearance on our road in and while at camp a moose walkthrough. Being from Alaska the moose did not bother us but those at the sites around us must have been from somewhere in the lower 48. Overall it was a great trip with lots of kayakinglittle bit of fishing and plenty of stories by the fire. Those who may be wondering there are plenty of RV sites and tent sites. Skilak is an every summer multiple times kind of thing. If you haven't been you live in Alaska you need to go. if you're not from Alaska make it one of your stops while you take your tour. And on a side notefor those of you who want your kids off of electronic devices there is little-to-no cell service or if you just need to have an excuse to get off your own.,0
"I cannot thank this office enough for their professional and kind demeanour and true compassion. The entire staff is amazing and the doctor is so intelligent and knowledable about dentistry. I have never been to a medical or dental office this exceptional. In years past, I was treated terribly at BTYW clinic, a secondary office associated to them, and then a very awful experience (s) at ALCAN. I was left with bad memories and apprehension all together to finding another dental provider. I was actually scared to even go to Anchorage Dental the day of my first appointment and was instantly made to feel safe and the ladies at the desk were so nice and sweet. As well, the hygienist and everyone. My doctor (dentist) addressed the concerns and did what all these other places failed to provide in the past 2 years. He was so on mark and did not mess around. I almost cried going home because I was finally validated that it was not me or my imagination that the former care I had received before coming here, was in fact horrible. I want to thank Anchorage Dental Group for restoring my faith in dentistry and for helping me get fixed what the other places did not address properly. I will refer only them to friends, family and the community in the future. You will not regret coming here. My gratitude is deep and again, thank you Anchorage Dental Group.",0
Horrible they never answer the phone I haven't been able to.get my mail for the past 2 weeks I've gone there multiple times and they always have some excuse and only one person working. 10-20-2016 I went back to the post office today and was told that I'm a liar and I have not been calling the post office to try to see about my mail I've been told multiple things over the last two weeks and there's no way for me to be able to contact them manager the people there are extremely rude and are incompetent at doing their jobs absolutely ridiculous.,0
Never been,3
Good.... I haven't been There in a long time.,3
"I preface this review with that I have never been white water rafting therefore had no idea what to do or expect. Shuttle was late for the pick up from the hotel, not like 2 or 3 minutes late, like 30 minutes late. So much so that we called them to see if we missed it but we were informed they were just running a little behind. We were told this was normal of them by our hotel. Next, did you know you needed waterproof gloves? I didnâ€™t but good thing they sell them in the office (expensive) but would have liked to know seeing how I had them at the hotel. Then we were told that if we didnâ€™t complete the online checkin there was a place to complete it. I found this funny since we were never given the option for online checkin. The front desk staff was rude and disorganized. Then I got in a dry suit that was wet inside and was told this was normal. After all this I almost just canned the whole trip but it was bucket list and I was in Alaska. So why am I telling you all this? Get past the registration, pick up and checkin process (which was awe full) and go on the trip you will not be disappointed. Cody was our guide and he did such a good job, we were laughing and a bit freaked out in spots the whole way. We did the Healy and it was such a great time. Jumped in the water and swam, why not your on a freezing cold river in Alaska. Loved how all the guides had swim trunks over their dry suits it made it easy to identify them. Overall a great river trip. Then you get back to the office to get back to your hotel. Disfunction again. Expect a great trip in the river, the rest of the process could use some reorganization.",0
NEVER BEEN THERE AND I WISH I WOULD QUIT GETTING REQUESTS TO REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3
Haven't been here yet but it's happening for my 50th birthday,3
"Never been to this garage, but I pass it all the time on my drive to and from Anchorage",3
"I have never been to this clinic. I called them to schedule an appointment to look at my left lymph node on my neck.No one answered the phone. It was after 10 a.m. I ended up calling patients first and I have an appointment at 7:00 p.m. on June 24,2020.",3
I've eaten here a few times and never been disspointed. The food is served in a timely manner and always hot. My silverware was less then clean so a better dishwasher maybe needed. The price is fair compared to the quality of food. The walls are looking rough inside. So I like to see some money reinvested back in to the business.,0
"My absolute only issue with this restaurant is that their tomato basil soup is seasonal. Although, any soup you have the opportunity to try will not disappoint. Both times I visited I ordered the filet mignon. I have never been disappointed. Their food is worth every penny and more. If the chance passes to give this place a try, do not say no.",0
Very clean and nice up kept facility. Always have activities for kids and adults which is nice during winter months. And their grounds outside are also very well kept and normally have events for our community. Staff has always been nice ive never been hassled or have complaints.,0
"I had never been snowmobiling before, and chose Rod's, to be my guide service, while on a solo bucket list adventure trip to Alaska. The equipment was awesome, the scenery was gorgeous, and my tour guide was the best!",0
didn't really like that michelle had forgotten the wrap towel and then forgot the astringent that your supposed to put on after the wax. then she was my pedicurist. nice atmosphere very relaxing. I guess i had three missed appointment i have never been sent an email or anything on the matter. so when you have three missed appointments theres a 50% surcharge before the appointment. They have an a tea thats so deliscious it doesnt need any sugar. They also have coffee and vanilla creamer. I went in for a buttox wax. They have a towel and wipes on the table. No pain. I was told by another waxer to put oil on the area an hour before and your wax should be virtually painless. When you walk up the stairs on the firts room rifht right wjen you walk into the waxing roo. If you look to the roght theres some purple hair dye and it looks like some wax stuck on the wall by the front right corner of the wall. The waxer told me that sje told Allure they need to repaint the walls,0
"I went there for the first time on my birthday Oct 2019 & I was not entirely disappointed. The food was delicious but they had some type of cross contamination issue that caused me to have a mild allergic reaction to their scallops. I informed the staff that seated us, the wait staff, and the chef that I have a fish allergy (I can only have shellfish). The only potential issue for a place like this for me would be if someone at my table ordered fish (which they did NOT) because then it would be cooked with the same utensils & on the grill as all the other food. Aside from that, I have dined at restaurants like this for over 15 years and literally all over the world.... and I have NEVER once had an allergy issue even when I don't say anything to the chef etc. If my family has its own table then I don't bother because I know that fish will not be made in conjunction with everyone else's meal.... but on the rare occasion where we have shared a table with other restaurateurs I make sure to inform all staff & it has never been an issue. The staff at Shogun was decent for the most part.... they could've been more attentive & friendly but no one was outright rude. The place is a bit on the smaller side compared to other steak houses I've been to but it didn't have a cramped feel at all.. it was a nice cozy vibe. I would suggest making a reservation if you plan to have a party of more than 2 people because it wouldn't be hard for the place to get packed, especially on the weekends. The food was the best thing about this place, the filet mignon was so tender it melts in your mouth ðŸ˜‹. The scallops caused me to have an allergic reaction so it may be possible they store it with fish... which wouldn't be wise or something wasn't cleaned properly ðŸ¤” Otherwise the scallops were perfectly cooked and the size was adequate so minus my allergic reaction I'd say they were good ðŸ˜‰ The only thing that I would improve is the portion sizes. The prices are far from cheap, which is normal for this type of dining experience, so for that fact alone they should provide generous amounts of food. I've been to other steak houses exactly like Shogun & they serve much bigger portions. Filling the plate with more rice and veggies would've been awesome! Overall, Shogun is a place I would return to & recommend that folks try... with a few advisments of course ðŸ™‚... but all in all the food tasted good. Hopefully my next visit will be a better one & I can update my rating ðŸ’œ",0
"The following is an example of the illegal and repulsive acts of a broker and agency for/of Pacific Rim Properties. We should have not fallen victim to their threats and intimidation. Incredibly we recently had cause to take a slum lord to court. The past dealings with thugs Pacific Rim taught us well. We not only won our retaliation case we were successful in pressing the owner by court order to repair. If you are current clients of PRP fight them if you are being taken advantage of. With all the vacancies currently in Anchorage and Mat SU choose a decent, reliable, legally responsible property management company. Stay far way from Pacific Rim Properties. Tracy Zeigler, agent for Pacific Rim Properties approached our home announcing his company had taken over management of our dwelling. Our home is one of two units of the same complex, the fact we were the only apartment being governed set off red flags as we had been having issues with the owner/landlord of the property for failure to supply heat and necessary maintenance. On June 9th, Mr. Ziegler served a Notice to Quit on my residence. This act was in direct retaliation by the owner/landlord of the property for our complaints above. (Please note, Mr. Zeigler is a personal friend of the owner/landlord Michelle Reynold's.) When Mr. Zeigler was alerted to our knowledge he had fraudulently filled out the Landlord's Record of Service on the Notice to Quit he returned on June 19th as an acting agent for Pacific Rim Properties again serving fraudulent, non relative documents on my family attempting to use his professional position to scare us from our home. These papers, of June 19th, include a notice of ABANDONMENT citing Alaska Statute 34.03.260 with accompanying photo copies; pages 47 & 48 of Termination for Absence or Abandonment. NOT in any reality do these items pertain to our occupancy. Yet again Pacific Rim Properties flooded us with ""Official"" documents in attempt to confuse us about our tenant rights. Also included on the Notice Of Abandonment is a signed statement certified by Terry Zeigler, agent for Pacific Rim Properties they have possession of our property. First, since we have never been outside our home for more then a few hours at any given time our property was not abandoned by definition of Alaska Statute 34.03.260 so whatever they took is thieved. Second, Pacific Rim Properties claims they are storing our personal belongings at a cost to us of $45 per day yet when I telephoned to claim these items they refuse to tell me what they have in their possession, where I can retrieve them or an itemized list of what was taken. Also served June 19th was a Prior Notice Of Entry, informing us Pacific Rim Properties intends on invading our home to, ""Verify Occupancy, Unit Condition"", on June 20th at approximately 1:15P.M. Pacific Rim Properties knows the rental IS occupied and there has been no reason whatsoever for concern of condition particularly since before moving in my husband and son spent two and a half days, using out of pocket expenses of more then $500 to fix the premises miserably left for us by the owner/landlord. This notice of entry is another attempt to unsettle my household. These trespasses are especially obscene in their harassing nature since Tracy Zeigler, Michelle Reynold's and others at Pacific Rim Properties are very well aware we have a critically ill five month old in our home who was just released mid-May after being treated for 12 and a half weeks at The Children's Hospital, Providence, in ICU and Pediatrics after he arrested 60 minutes respiratory and cardiac at 5 weeks from a then undiagnosed condition of chronic kidney failure. With our sons reduced respiratory responses his immune system is extremely vulnerable. Having unnecessary trampings in our home by these individuals is a health risk for him particularly at this time when he is still fighting pneumonia from when the landlord turned off our heat June 5th in attempt to drive us from our home.",0
If you haven't been you need to. They make fantastic sandwiches on in house made bread. They make scrumptious pastries and huge cinnamon rolls.,3

"Really good pizza. The restaurant has a good vibe if you're dining in. We've gotten it to go several times and have never been dissatisfied. The pear pizza (can't think of the name of it) is phenomenal, I've ordered one of those every time we order.",0
Never been,3
Haven't been here yet but it's happening for my 50th birthday,3
I have never been in they.,3
Both me and my friend got followed around the store and made to feel like we weren't welcome. I had never been there before and would have loved to spend some time looking and bought a couple gifts for people. But not after the way the staff acted. That was very unprofessional and uncalled for. Won't be back,0
If you have never been to Club Paris put it on your to do list when you're looking for a perfect stake and don't forget the appetizers and desserts.,3

Nice low key dining with a solid menu. Never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.,0
Haven't been in the store for over a year or so,3
"I haven't been here in a few years, but it has gone downhill. What used to be a unique boutique that carried homemade Alaskan goods, slowly turned into any other tourist attraction that sold ""made in China"" crap that you can find at Fred's. Hopefully the owners turn it around (or already have)",3
"Very quick and easy service. It lives up to its ""express"" title. I've only been in there once but when I did there was no line and I was helped immediately. I haven't been there in several years and when I was there the counters were VERY tall. I'm 5'1"" but I don't have problems at other establishments counter space. Here I had to nearly tip toe to sign documents. If they haven't fixed this I recommend they do. Either way it wouldn't deter me from returning.",0
"""The website ad for 2 pairs for $59.95 said that the glasses could be finished in 15 minutes, but when I arrived, I was informed that the frames that qualified for the deal had to be mailed in, which would take two weeks. This information wasn''t shared until after I had already gone through and paid for the exam, otherwise I would not have gone with your company. I was then told that if I went with other frames, they could be completed in-store, obviously a slimy tactic to get customers to purchase more expensive frames. I then chose other frames only to be informed at the last second that my prescription was too high for them to be completed that day. This was after I called ahead of making an appointment to ensure that my high prescription would not cause any additional expenditure, delay, or other issue. Customers should be informed ahead of time that the \""15 minutes\"" does not apply to everyone and that if you have a high prescription, it may cause significant delay."" I sent that correspondence on July 1, a couple days after my experience in the store. I called July 12 and was told that my glasses would arrive in Anchorage the next day. They told me they would be shipped to me in Fairbanks and should arrive at my address in two days. It is now July 21 and I have still not received my glasses. This is after my horrified experience in the store, where I felt mislead and taken advantage of even after my attempts to proactively ensure I would receive service as advertised. It has now been almost a month and I have not received my glasses. This is absolutely unacceptable and bordering on illegal. I have paid cash money with the expectation that I receive a product in return the same day. Stanton Optical has failed to do so and you has failed to provide reasonable recourse for that failure. I honestly believe I should be issued a full refund at this point in addition to the $50 credit they have applied to my account. I have never been so angry, sad, and disappointed at a company. I have a high prescription, just started a new job, and really need my glasses for work. I rely on them too much and the incompetence of Stanton Optical has caused me a great deal of not only emotional strain, but additional strain on my eyes. I originally went in because my glasses broke and I chose Stanton because they were supposed to offer the fastest replacement. I now highly regret ever choosing Stanton. I would advise that you try any other option before you even consider choosing them yourself for fear that you might experience similar horror and literal physical pain from eye strain. FALSE ADVERTISING",0
This place is a bit small and out of the way but it lets you rent materials to play Warhammer. They also have a decent amount of figures and CCG supplies in stock. They don't advertise as much and I only heard of them by word of mouth but I am glad I stopped by. They do host games if you call ahead. Check them out if you have time.,0
Never been to the top of the hike but I've been on the trails and in the parking area below. It's all well maintained. It is a very scenic area with a gorgeous view of the Inlet.,3
Never been there and might have walked near or gone by on bus,3
"Great beer, food was delicious, albeit it took almost 45 min to an hour because our 'ticket didn't print' to the kitchen. Service is strange setup, if you've never been. It outwardly appears like a regular full service restaurant, but it's not. You order at the counter, and they deliver to your table number. No servers. No one will check on you, so be sure to go inside for anything you need. Smoked provolone and the Sriracha IPA grilled chicken are ðŸ”¥",0
"I haven't been to all the shops but the ones I've gone to I have visited often. Country Kitchen, for example, is a hidden treasure that I can't believe it took me 5 years of living here to find. There is also Fairbanks Yoga and Anytime Fitness which are wonderful as well.",0
"We have eaten at this McDonalds on more than 5 occasions, each time going through the drive through. Our order has never been correct. Once, we got two or more orders, probably $80 worth of food when we ordered $30. There's something seriously wrong with the McDonald's management here and I hope the owners get to the bottom of it before it gets to the bottom of their wallets. That said, the people were nice.",0
Never been disappointed. If you're not happy they'll fix it.,0
"My family visits this establishment at least once a month. We hit it early when it's more appropriate to take our 5 year old. Amazing tacos, fries, wings, po-boys at a reasonable price. Nelton and the staff are great. Never been there for the nightlife but I hear your chances of having fun and getting drunk are good.",0
Had a wonderful time tonight. My friend was visiting from Fairbanks and she's never been. Pete K. was an excellent server and The Hangar has never let me down!!! Thank you!,3
"What a great store! They carry so many of the special Asian foods that I haven't been able to find anywhere in Anchorage. I was not expecting such a great selection. So many of the items I couldn't find at New Sagaya, I was able to find here. Love it!",0
"My cat is an out door cat and would see and visit our neighbors so I assumed he was fine. He was captured and taken to the pound. I had him for 10 years and He has never been to the pound. When I finally realized he was not with neighbors I called the pound and they said he was there. I asked if they could hold him for me one extra day cause I just gave birth to my son, still in the hospital, with a one day old son. They said they couldn't. I was heart broken because later that day someone adopted him. What i don't understand is that they had a chance to give my cat back to his original owners. I traveled with my cat. Had him since he was a kitten, He was with me throughout two pregnancies. My husband and I were heart broken. So when my son's birthday comes around we think of our cat the day before because that was the day we lost one of our family members. My cat also saved my son from a pitbull attack I love and miss him dearly.",3

Have never been there before. It was great food and awesome staff!,0
Never been unsatisfied! One of my favorite places for a haircut!,0
"Never been to the top, but the views are beautiful.",3
I like the value of the sweets and fast boxed ready foods. I like how the store has variety of fruits and veggies. One thing i dont like is the way my groceries were bagged. I know they train their cashiers and courtesy clerks to arrange your groceries in a way so that they dont spill or tear the bags. But my experience has never been ok in that area. Some do a really good job but most are just lazy.,0
Never been there,3
"Party of 6, and each with their own problems. I ordered a Smoky Tavern burger and halfway through I realized that I had forgot what I ordered because it tasted like a regular burger, probably because it was, except a large pump of barbeque sauce at the very end. The grilled cheese shouldn't even be called a grilled cheese, it was barely cooked at all and drowning in butter. The avocado burger didn't have avocado on it. The chips from the nachos tasted stale, and my water glass was shattered on the bottom, not to leaking point but very unprofessional. The only thing that could have made it worse was the service, so it's appreciated that the service was good. Not the most helpful but it was pretty busy and I'm sure everyones trying their best. In the end, we haven't been having good experiences on our last few trips and we won't be coming back.",0
"Whether or not I'll get a burned shot is always a gamble at other drive through coffee places but it's never been an issue here. Excellent quality. Friendly people, local company. I highly recommend them!",0
"Large day use park(would even be nice for a party) and campground for RV w/hookup and many spots for tenting. Also has a place to shower that you'll need quarters for. A few trails to walk through, very beautiful walk, and you can go down to the river. Recommend taking a camera. It's across the street from a small airfield, but during my two day stay there I only heard a plane twice, so not a busy airfield. The camp host is a gentleman, happy to chat with anyone who stops by. He has a lot of Rhubarb growing in front so he picks it when it's ready and offers it to the guests. The grounds are kept beautifully. Super close to downtown; it took me less than five minutes to drive to Fred Meyers. Both RV and tenting spots are far enough away from the main road that you can't hear the traffic at night.",0
Haven't been in in like 6 months but I'm sure it's Great I'm sure the tacos taste the same,3
"Although I have lived in Eagle River AK for the past 12 yrs - I had never been to Talkeetna. When I found this tour online I immediately booked it - 1 1/2 months prior! Captain Izzy & Deck hand Abby are from the local area and very knowledgeable about the area, history and even shared personal stories. THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Mt. Denali was out in all it's full glory and there was plenty to see and learn about. The skills of navigating the McKinley Queen through the vast wilderness and through the white rapids-even to the class 5 rapids is beyond impressive. Izzy & Abby are are very personable, answering any questions we may have, engaging and interacting-all this makes the tour worth every penny! Show less",3
"The food tasted ok, and it was for a fair price, and the staff seemed nice. However, the place was over condensated, the windows were fogged and frozen over (on the inside even!!!), it smelled kind of bad in the place, the restrooms were not real clean and they downright stank, and even though the food tasted ok (maybe even pretty good) it was slightly less than lukewarm (maybe even a wee bit on the cold side). The place has never been perfect, but it's going downhill now, too... so sad!!! :-(",0
"Probably a standard Fred Meyer, but have never been to any others. Lots of things.",3
"They were very nice when it came to replacing my pizza when there was a very minor issue and they always have good deals if you know the coupon code. I've never been a fan of their bread as it doesn't stay hot long enough and it sucks they charge you for parmesan and red pepper packets as other pizza joints offer those as complimentary. Still, they remain consistent in what they do and rarely have I had a negative experience in all the years I ordered from them.",0
"Delicious. I order Pho here very frequently and have never been disappointed. Itâ€™s always so hot and so flavorful, perfect for cold winter days!",0
"They have a awesome amount of hard to find hardware and fasteners + just about anything else you need. And there Crew and cashers are top notch people always willing to help. And always in a great mood. I go there for most of my projects, and there close to my home which makes it all the better. I've never been disappointed with True value ever.",0
"Haven't been in a while, customer service is not as good as it used to be.",0
"I was recently there for cocktails and I have to say I was impressed with the selection of drinks, and the menu was great. If you haven't been in a while, it might be worth checking out again.",3
Their food is out of this world. Amazing flavor combinations you won't see anywhere else in anchorage. Every time I go I get something different and I have never been disappointed. They also have amazing cocktails and scrumptious deserts. This is a must for any foodies in the anchorage area.,0
Never been here before and asked the cashier how much people usually pay for a full cup and she completely misrepresented the actual price per ounce. Set rates would be appreciated as well as smaller cup sizes.,3
I was pleased with my visit. Had never been here before this but I've been wanting to go back. Love the crust choices as well as choosing my own toppings. The speed in which you get the pizza after ordering is amazing. Wish they would open in the Valley.,3
I love love this place. If you haven't been here I highly recommend it. Staff is great and friendly,0
"I've been wearing my hair naturally for over three years and I have never been more pleased with it than when I visited Totally Natural Hair Salon. They have exceptional customer service, quality service, and are COVID19 compliant!",0
Lived in anchorage for 5 years and have never been to kavas . The service and food were great and the portions are very generous. I highly recommend this place,0
"Fantastic, quick service. Great for a fast lunch downtown. The food is good, quality food but not anything unique. Prices are high, but comparable to other restaurants downtown. The service has never been anything less than exemplary. Overall, well worth a stop if you're looking for lunch downtown.",0
Definitely was worth it if youâ€™ve never been give it a try!,3
"I used to go here once every few months. I haven't been in 5 years or so, but I always had a great experience at the Grape Tap. One day when I'm making better money again, I plan to return. But I always tell people The Grape Tap is the place you take that important first date to, special occasions. ONLY complaint, if you can even call it that, would be to offer some minimal liquor, as I'm a Bacardi and Diet Coke man and wine just does not agree with me, but this is offered as more of an ""opportunity,"" than complaint. Great place, though. I even know some people in Anchorage who make the trip out to dine here several times a year. Glad to see it's thrived and that the Valley actually CAN do classy when it tries.",0
"For someone that has never been to Alaska, I would recommend it. It is a little campy, and a bit expensive, but worth the time.",3
Shake and a burger never been disappointed ordering here double bacon burger YA!!! Great service,0
"Our keys worked but our room was dirty and hadn't been cleaned. Mosquitoes everywhere, literally by the billions and NO bug spray. 1 gift shop, 1 coffee shop, 2 restaurants. Nice grounds, but too too many mosquitoes to enjoy it. Only 1 hot tub area super far from my room. No air conditioning and it was 80 so good luck later in the season if your here. Why is there NO BUG SPRAY. who allows that to happen when you know you have bus loads of people getting dropped off and you know theres mosquitoes. I dont know theres mosquitoes because I've never been here but they know and they're not adequately stocked. I've got bites over my entire body. They even got in my clothes and came back to my room. I have all day here so yay this sucks. I'm leaving here totally bitten up by mosquitoes and a prisoner to my room unless I want more because I wasnt one of the ""lucky"" people who got to purchase they're tiny over priced travel size bug spray. Other than all that, my Turkey sandwich was ok, too dry for my liking. Looking forward to leaving here, this is not so much fun.",0
"Iâ€™ve been a Jitters customer since the late 90â€™s and in my 20 years supporting this locally owned business I have never been disappointed. Iâ€™ve raised my children on their toasted marshmallow steamers and their lemon cookies and banana bread are guilty pleasures. What I love most is that this is truly a community gathering place. You are bound to run into someone you know or make a new friend if you so much as smile. They host art openings, concerts and have a conference room in the back for meetings, parties or events. The large fireplace is a cozy spot to plant yourself in front of in the winter, in the summer they have tables out front. And on days when you donâ€™t have time to park and walk in, their drive-thru fits the bill. The have games, WiFi and plenty of tables making it a great location for work or study as well. With few hang out options for teens in Eagle River, it is wonderful to know that they are welcome here as well. Update Summer 2020 - Iced everything is worth visiting their drive-thru even on the hottest of days. Thanks for the lemonade soda and iced green tea Maddie...delicious! Update Fall 2020 - They have Egg Nog (because, donâ€™t let anyone know I said this, Pumpkin Spice isnâ€™t for everyone). They also have a special this week called the Funny Bunny. I gave it a try and it was very yummy! Maddie took care of me again...we talked about binge watching Criminal Minds and registering to vote (which everyone should do) in my 4 minutes there...she has customer engagement down!",0
Their doughnuts were good I have never been here before until now,3
Did not visit,2
"I haven't been in the Iditarod Dining Facility in over a decade. Finally went back and was very pleased that nothing had changed. Service was great, people were friendly, and the food was delicious. I will be going back at least once a week.",0
The earthquake simulator was awakening. Being from Minnesota I have never been in a quake.,3
"Never been disappointed at this location. Follows the normal subway brand. The store is clean, although a little small. Sometimes the under-do the veggies but mostly good.",0
I wouldnâ€™t give this place a star at all ! Except I had to in order for me to write my review of this disgusting place!!! ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤¢I spent $60.00 on delivery which was late! The food was cold and the fried rice tasted like steam rice was more vegetables in it then anything The almond chicken tasted like it was two days old and the sweet n sour pork was nasty I thought I was eating chicken gizzards ha ha and the grease they cooked it in tasted like it has never been changed and now as Iâ€™m writing this I have a purfume taste in my mouth ! I only ate here because itâ€™s motherâ€™s day and our regular Chinese place was closed and y mother canâ€™t go out so we had a horrible Motherâ€™s Day dinner Needles to say I wonâ€™t return back ever,0
Really great food and environment. I love coming here for breakfast and have never been disappointed with the food or service. Prices are pretty fair too.,0
"Chepo's has the best JalapeÃ±o Poppers I've ever tasted. Whatever I've ordered anthing with seafood, I've always been impressed by the serving size. Extremely good service. I've never been disappointed!",0
"Really great place for swimming, working out, and just overall not that bad. However, the membership fees are quite expensive and is kind of worth it only if you're going as a family. In addition, when I went in to see how much the membership fee would cost, the person that was giving us a tour felt very semi-""aggressive"" in making sure we signed up when we only went in to look. So I'd say when going in, be on your guard and don't lose to their membership plans right away.Also, I didn't have this specific experince but I've heard that many people have been ""scammed"" in some shape or form because they werent noticed about an enrollment fee or that there is a 1-year commitment, so watch out and ask questions about that. Also, personally, they told me for me they would not apply the $800 enrollment fee, but I've heard some have actually paid that, so be stubborn about it and they might give you that ""promo"" as well. Furthermore, when giving you a tour, the person giving me the tour was saying words such as ""cheap places"", basically trying to emphasize that other ""cheap gyms"" were not as great as this one. Don't let that fool you, Body Renewal has pretty much almost the same number of treadmills and cardio stuff as Alaska Club so don't fall for it. I'm not saying they are lying or claiming they are frauds, just evidence. But going in to the actual gym, it's clean and not bad. There are a lot of treadmills and bicycles. The pool is fairly large and there are jacuzzis and spas there as well. The main workout area is clean again, approximately 4-6 stations for the classic deadlifts, squats, and etc. They also have rock climbing which is located right when you enter. I'd suggest asking for a 3-day pass to see if you're interested because there are cheaper options if you're going to be working out alone and only working out without swimming and all that. The interior is pretty nice until you reach the hallway that connects many things, the paint is pretty beat up and looks like it has never been finished painting and starts to smell kind of weird, but not to the point where you get knocked out. But overall, a decent gym.",0
"My all time favorite place for goodies, sandwiches, lunch, even breakfast!!! Everything they make is completely amazing. I've never been disappointed..... I would give them 10* if I could.",0
Never been inside hears it's tiny,3
If you never been There it's a good place to take the kids for history listen,3
"I've never been disappointed by these places. Always great service, great food, and great atmosphere. Perfect for large crowds.",0
"Fred's is a good place to shop for groceries, household stuff, as well as for outdoors stuff.. if you never been, it's definitely worth checking out.",3
"Great prices, and they have a sandwich and soup lunch special. Good service, hometown environment. Parking is limited but well worth a try if you haven't been. If your looking for coffee this spot has a great selection of hot drinks as well.",0
"Took my kids ages 3,5,7,13 they all enjoyed it and so did I. The younger man that greeted us was friendly and interacted with the kids well. The tour guide is so full of knowledge of our local history. I highly encourage, if you haven't been there, go at least once. It's not because it's super exciting but just for a hint of where this town comes from.",3
"I've never been much for Indian food, but this place has me hooked!",0
"I've been camping in Alaska for over 20 years and I am amazed that I have never been to Finger Lakes State Rec Area. It is such an awesome little gem of a campground right in between Palmer and Wasilla. It's beautiful, clean, spacious, and quiet. And there is a boat launch for the lake, which allows motorized boats. You can fish on the lake or off one of the two docks. Fishing is supposed to be decent, but my friend and I had zero luck catching anything. The reason I gave 4/5 was the price of the campsites are really expensive per night ($25/$35 per night for tent/premium camping). I think the high cost becomes a bit prohibitive for the average camper and there are more cost friendly options along the Wasilla/Palmer Highway.",3
"Nice, elegant place downtown to enjoy some scrumptious Latin cuisine. Great for lunch or dinner. Iâ€™ve never been there for the live music but have been told that it is excellent as well. Parking can be a but tricky but thatâ€™s what you expect when you go downtown. I love this little gem in Fairbanks.",3
"Haven't been to Taco Bell in years. I went to this Taco Bell and ordered $90 worth of food. After a second time pulling through the drive-through to stall and kill time for them and to be out of the way for the other customers that were behind me. In the middle of the night I got my order, pulled out, parked & checked absolutely everything from top to bottom &&& they didn't miss a beat! Other than the hot sauces (I didn't get any hot sauces) but as far as the food goes Not only was it all there it looked like the pictures on TV or in their advertisements! It wasn't all flat and bunk looking it was Fluffy and big & packed! So I pulled back in again and tipped all four of the workers twenty bucks each : ) Needless to say that was the most expensive $170 Taco Bell meal EVER but it was very good && worth it!",0
Never been there,3
Members of the staff were extremely rude disrespectful and Unbecoming of professionals I would not recommend staying here unless you absolutely had to I do not give many negative reviews this is one of them the facilities are amenities in the rooms were nice staff was horde disrespectful and ugly with there nature of behavior and their demeanor I have never been so disrespected at any establishment where I have spent more than a little bit of money and did not cause any problems instead the staff insisted on making me feel welcomed and it hurts for me to have to do this review since I do not like having to give negative reviews but I could not let this go unchecked it would not be honorable of me to do so,0
"Best food on the peninsula. Been Fan of Ramiros cooking for over 10 years. Best food,best value,absolute best people. I still haven't made it all the way through their menu and have never been dissapointed. Closed sundays and mondays.",0
"This option for dining has NEVER let me down or the guest I've brought. Even in their busiest times I have never been let down or disappointed. The business is open to anyone, (if you just came out of a sewer you shouldn't go anywhere but to get cleaned anyway). The place is a specialty of fine dining so of course (lame) McDonalds pricing isn't on the menu, so be real. For my wife, son and myself I didn't care how much I spent for us to enjoy GREAT Food, Great Views, Great Service and Sincere Customer Service. The employees appear Happy and, I've never seen them treat each other hostile or be rude to over zealous customers who ""Think"", they are the only ones dining. S&S is the Place to enjoy, and escape from the brew joints and Anchorage's sometimes ugliness.",0
"Good quality service, never been disappointed. Pricing is fair & competitive for the area. They stand by their work & very ethical. Had a tire repair needed, they did their best but due to a manufacturing seem oddity they couldn't quite seal it 100% & heavily discounted the repair despite my wanting to pay for their time in full.",0
LOVED IT! Our server Sarah was PERFECT! It was really busy and she was working alone and handled all our special requests with ease and smiles. She checked on us multiple times and my friend who had never been there said he loved the patio and experience and wanted to come back with other friends soon to enjoy the sun and patios relaxed atmosphere.,0
Started off with a skirt stead salad with honey mustard dressing. Steak was out of this world and cooked to perfection. Had the 6oz prime cut cooked med. and again another prefect steak. Never been anywhere and had two great steaks. If staying here it is a must for dinner.,3
"Nice small underground bar that's more than meets the eye at first, would recommend if never been before.",3
"Hippies and Patchouli oil get together with there extratuffs to throw a fair it's an experience for the whole family, if you have never been you really need to check it out lots of fun super friendly people and lots of hand crafted items, some of which is the locals main source of income for the year so pleas support local sellers and hand crafts maker's! Its local and fun for everyone.",0
"Carrs is carrs. However, carrs took out the self check, so that's annoying. Haven't been elsewhere in the center.",3
My experience has never been phenomenal at this restaurant at this location. The person working the drive-thru window wasn't very into what he was doing so the interaction was quite annoying. Outside of the restaurant needs a good cleaning since the dust and gravel from the winter have thawed and is everywhere. The philly pepper steak sandwich was nothing to brag about. Didn't even look attractive. Flavor wasn't there either but I ate it. I will stick to what they are good at. The roast beef sandwiches,0
The food is yummy & made to order. The delivery is fast and they give a discount for delivery orders. I've been a few times & haven't been disappointed yet. Great place for real food but is still quick and has decent prices.,0
Haven't been here in years. I had the mac n cheese and hubby had the double bacon burger. Both were good and large portions. I only ate half of mine. Definitely enough fir 2 people to share. Service was friendly ðŸ˜ƒ,0
The pizza is incredible. You can never go wrong with a mooses tooth pizza. Everything else is great on the menu. In the numerous times I have been I have never been disappointed by the food. Service can be hit and miss. At peak hours the wait can be very long. Especially during summer. If you have not been Go! Oh BTW they have beer...lots and lots of beer. People say the beer is good. I don't drink beer.,0
I haven't been to this place once when the experience was not worth the wait. All different types of high quality pizza and beer. If ur not on a diet or looking for a cheat day better check this place out.,0
I've eaten here religiously for over 7 years. I have never been served a single dish that was less than absolutely amazing. Service is friendly and quick. Pricing is amazing. One of the best restaurants in the state.,0
Picked up my son from here haven't been here,3
Never been there.,3
never been a fan of fake pizza,3
Well I go for the outstanding Mexican meals. I have never been diusapointed!,3
"We've been to Harley's several times and have never had a bad experience! Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but I can assure you it's worth it. The food is always delicious, and the coffee is great as well. If you've never been here, I highly suggest you give it a try!",0
Never been disappointed with their food,0
Even when they're busy the food (and beer) is excellent. I recommend the mystery beer. I've never been disappointed.,0
I usually order the specials and haven't been disappointed yet. I keep hearing the Korean bibimbap is great.,3
"The food was pretty good and the people were very nice, but the whole restaurant was DIRTY. The bathrooms were disgusting. They smelled and looked terrible. They need repairs as well as a thorough cleaning. The toilet was separating from the wall. The sinks spray high pressure water so you get wet trying to use them. The playground looks as though it's never been cleaned in the inside (I climbed in with the kids). It was just GROSS.",0
Stopped by there from out of town to see some friends. Haven't been there in a few years but it looks a little run down. Needs of face lift. Not quite Sheraton level material. Disappointing.,3
"Love them. Never been disappointed. Does amazing nail art, no one else in town would. Reasonably priced",0
"Never been there, but I wish like to!",3
"It's KFC, service is generally acceptable. Orders have always been right, never been served dry chicken like at other KFC locations.",0
"Environment is great. The chefs are very friendly. The food? Amazing and priced well. If you haven't been here before, go to it. I have to say it's my favorite restaurant in Juneau. My favorite food is the classic BLT. I get it just about every time I go there.",0
Your average Denny's. They do things a little different. Its the Northern Most Denny's. The food has always been prepared well and I have never been disappointed. Wait staff is normally short staffed but the wait has never seamed to busy to get you what you need.,0
"I've only been here for the endless lunch soup, but have never been disappointed. The soup was always good and the service was always super friendly. We never had to worry about running out of breadsticks or salad, and everyone in our party had a great time",0
The selection at this location is great! I enjoy deconstructing some of my favorite Thai and Japanese foods and then getting the ingredients to practice at home! I have never been disappointed with the amount of choice they offer. Itâ€™s also a nice place to visit with a friend for a yummy snack or tasty coffee!,0
"The lines are always pretty long and it takes forever to place your order. The managers haven't been very kind, but the normal workers are always friendly. The food is good though",0
"My favorite restaurant in town! The food is excellent, I have never been disappointed. They have the best borscht I have ever tasted. I would just get a big bowl of that if everything else wasn't so good! The BÄƒtutÄƒ (chicken cutlet) and ColÈ›unaÈ™i cu Cartofi (potato pierogies) are my favorites! The desserts are always fantastic as well. The service is phenomenal as well! MulÈ›umesc Soba! ðŸ’œ",0
"Wasn't that good. Food was over salted, I can cook better than this place. We've never been there after the first time.",0
Food was good the place was very clean. But I have never been back and probably never will.,0
"Horrible service. Chips were stale. We literally had to hail down our waitress, never did get a glass of water. Now I know why I haven't been there in 10 years.",0
"Every time I go to my boyfriends house it asks me if I'm here I've never been but if I review it, the pop up will stop so yeah eat there it looks cool",3
Never been to Korea but it seems pretty authentic! Amazing food and service.,0
"Haven't been to a restaurant for dine in fir quite sometime. Love this place, the variety & the service!",0
"Convenient, hard-to-miss pull off on the highway with fantastic scenic views of the Inlet and the Turnagain arm. I haven't been here in the summer to see any whales, however.",3
"As with all springhill locations, the rooms are suites. I have never been to one that was not nice. The restaurant downstairs is BOMB",3
"I did not go on this fishing trip but my niece, her husband, 2 boys ages 8 and 9, plus my nephew and brother in law. It was booked via Kenai Magic Lodge and since they were departing out of Ninilchik the boat ride was not as long. My family told me the crew was not that friendly but very serious about helping all and getting the fish into the boat. They knew they were not fishing for barn doors but were very happy my nephew caught the fish halibut that was around 60lbs. They all caught their limits and shipped several lbs home. They only wanted a half day and got more time so everyone had a chance to catch their limit. They were satisfied on their day. Only my brother in law got sick and he has boated most of his life, some in the Atlantic.",0
"I haven't been to the Northern Lights Fred's in quite a while. What happened? It was dirty, messy, poorly stocked and minimal selections. As I tried to do some grocery shopping i couldn't believe how awful the store is. When they did their remodel it was in better shape, and we all remember how horendeous that was.",3
I have always had a pleasant time each time I come here. Staff have always greeted us and were seated rather quickly. The food is very yummy! Wait time to order or waiting for the food has never been a problem. The wait staff are very good at suggesting something if you are stuck with what to order.,0
Haven't been since 1985 & it made me cry. It was breathtaking as usual. Nighttime was best!!!.,3
"Good service, great food, amazing portion sizes. I have never been disappointed eating here and will be visiting again soon",0
Never been to this place but I vibe with the name,3
Never been let down and they always saw to it that one was fully ready when renting!,0
"2020 COVID: I'm so impressed with how this lot has their act together. A class above anywhere close to being this big in town. I felt so underprepared going in to pick up my food and I had all expectations surpassed. Definitely worth a go, even with most places being shut down. 2019: just went and saw captain marvel in 3d. Didn't even know bear did 3d. Needless to say the chain theaters can have their fancy chairs. Beer and pizza in a respectful environment any time. People came in and out of line without fuss or cutting, one personhad their phonego off unexpectedly and booked it for the door. Some food was brought out later than anticipated, not mine, but the staff handled it elegantly. Cone checks were done to provide as little intrusion as possible. Theater isn't even at a deafening volume in comparison. I would rather go here than anywhere else, given that parking is assured. Parking is the worst part of the whole experience. 2013:Have been here on a number of occasions, foreign movies and local, the establishment itself is great. Only time I have a bad time is if I get stuck next to an undesirable, but the Tooth never lets me down. If you haven't been here, you must be new here.",0
Never been just walked through,3
Ive never been disappointed with their food or service. Fair prices. Not a bad place to order from on a party night.,0
It was fun but very expensive. I have never been before and didn't expect that.,3
"Possibly the best Chinese food in town, I've never been in when they aren't crowded. If you go to late in the day they start to run out of things. I want tp try their cake, ot seems like they sell a lot of birthday cakes.",0
This was my first bike ride on the Ted Knowles Coastal trail. We started at Lyn ayr park going towards downtown. It was a bit crowded near the lagoon and the closer you get to downtown area. Since I haven't been on a bike in years. It was a bit difficult for me to navigate around all the strollers and kids walking and other bikers. So we turned around and ride to earthquake park area. Beautiful day and quite scenic.,3
Best. Mexican. Food. Ever. EVERY TIME! I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered! Super friendly service - and I have visited almost every location in Anchorage. Every location is consistent and AMAZING. Highly recommended!!!,0
"Always delicious, always quick! Service has never been bad.",0
"The one time we came here there was a homeless camp set up in the pick-nick area (there is a trail that runs through the woods right up to the back of the park). We didn't stay, and haven't been back.",3
Omg. So I've never been to this place before and wow. They got some awesome food. There pulled pork awesome and the chicken is amazing. Definitely recommend this place,0
Crepes of the day are THE BEST! Every day they have a sweet crepe amd a savory crepe. Get one of each! I've never been disappointed!,0
I had a hard time sticking to a trail. As long as you good footing and found Someone else's footsteps you could keep moving up. This had great views and I had a fun time taking Pictures. This is a very difficult trail and may be difficult getting back down due to the loose rocks and muddy areas. I did not go all the way to the top because I was cold. Just because the temperature is nice near the starting base doesn't mean you shouldn't bring a jacket or coat. It also has its steep points. Bring a friend in the phone to ensure your safety.,0
The staff is always friendly and helpful. I've never been disappointed with their food. The staff has been really cautious during the pandemic.,0
Haven't been there in about 20 years and its still delicious YUMMMM!,3
They continuously mess up your order. Ive never been through there where they havent messed it up.,3
"I would love to say that I had a good experience here, however I didn't. My car was stuck going up a hill and these guys were the only place open. I ended up spending over $600+ on studs, which was fine as I'd need them anyway. I bought a whole set, obviously, so when it became spring, I had to have my tires changed. I tried to go back to them and was told that I had to purchase a whole new set of tires in order for them to put my summer tires on.I didn't need a new set of summer tires, so the guy told me he wouldn't switch them. What made me angry is that I had just purchased a new set of studs less than 5 months before. This was the year it didn't snow until very late so I didn't need studs as early as I usually would. I was perfectly willing to pay to have my tires changed over, I'm used to it. But I've never been told that I had to buy a whole new set just to have that happen. I switched over to Diversified Tires and haven't had to buy anything except the cost of the tire switch.",0
"I downloaded their app and made an appointment without much hope of being seen as it was only 2 or so weeks away. To my suprise they confirmed it for the date and time I had requested. I showed up with my little kitty, Milos and had an easy check in. They had us in a room within minutes. The part I really loved about Mt McKinley Animal Hospital is that any time they had to do shots, take blood, or do anything invasive they would take Milos out of the room and bring him back when it was done. It was always fast and I didnt have to watch my baby get poked. Watching just breaks my heart (I'm a whimp when it comes to Milos) so I cannot tell you how much this meant to me. I have never been to a vet clinic that takes the time to make both the animal and owner feel so comfortable. It was a great experience and I will be going back.",0
I have never been disappointed coming here every sandwich is amazing.I love the turkey and bacon!,0
"Celebrated my would be wedding day here. The chef really celebrates food,m the menu has seasonal items with some staples. Iâ€™ve been to the south and have NEVER had better fried chicken this sophisticated and legit as here. Also Iâ€™m an Alaskan fisher I never order fish at a restaurant... but this spot literally is worth it and no fish has ever tasted BETTER. Literally never been disappointed, worth a day trip of 4 hours round trip. This is the best spot to eat in Alaska. Anchorage food has nothing on this spot. Eat here, tip well, and REPEAT.",0
"This is my favorite breakfast location in Fairbanks by far! I want to be clear though that this is not exclusively a breakfast location at all. I just happened to go for breakfast is all. First off, they have a very large menu of all kinds of crepes. I was actually taken aback a bit with the unexpected variety that was available! They have a breakfast crepe menu, but I instead opted for a savory a savory ham and smoked gouda crepe to start off with. I followed it up with an amazingly delicious dessert crepe consisting of a creme cheese filling with blueberries and sliced strawberries. It was really good! The chef even came out personally to see if I was ready for the dessert crepe to be started before making it, so it was timed perfectly after I was finishing my ham and gouda crepe. This restaurant is in my top two places to eat so far in Fairbanks. Unfortunate, I haven't been able to go back since. They had to close temporarily for a maintenance issue with their heating. I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it as I'm writing this review though.",3
My lawsuit hasn't even finished and this has been the worst experience of my life. My prayer is God make a miracle happen because hoping for them(Crowson) to care about me as an person is far from being close. They don't care about you as human or help or guide you in this process. They have been so late informing me about anything. Now I'm going in to surgery without a care from the people who are representing me. Sad that I was referred to them only not get the same service the referral got.. I honestly feel if I die on the surgery table they could care less and or make sure that my children would be taking care of. It been over a year and I'm not going to lie I'm ready for this to end; without putting myself in place where I come up short. They had the nerve in December of 2020 ask me if I would like to settle. Yes my finances haven't been the greatest in the process but they know I was planning to have surgery. After surgery more physical therapy is needed..If I had settled I would have pay out of pocket to make sure I was better.. Caring about a person it check up on them let them know your there for them.. Breaking down Information so everything is clear.. This is an unpleasant experience and my prayer is that I never have to experience this again.. PLEASE PLEASE DO YOUR LEG WORK BEFORE COMING HERE. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU AS INDIVIDUAL... Super disappointed!!,0
The Deadliest Catch was super delightful. The service our waiter provided was very well mannered and did not rush us. Anytime I have went there I have never been disappointed. Food and service is unbeatable. I can only imagine if they had a dinner menu. Thank you to snow city cafe.,0
"By far the best Prime Rib I've ever had. This place has had the hand of god touch their cooks, because it is unreal how amazing the food is. Also has the best salad bar in town! I will keep coming back here time and time again, there is no place like it anywhere else in the world. If you haven't been, plan your next outing at the Turtle Club. I promise you it will be worth your while.",0
I never been and having seen the way that they park customer autos i would not recommend.,3
"I went here because you see pho places everywhere. I never had much interest in Asian food places besides chinese buffets every so often. But if pho wasn't good, it wouldn't be so popular. It was close to the base so it was a good lunch spot. I've never been to a pho restaurant before. I was godawful tired of the base chow hall, Burger King, Wendys, and occasionally McDonalds so besides the pricey Tempura Express, I decided to take a chance at something new. Woo hoo, what a find! I was a bit nervous walking in there, expecting nasty looks from the hostess and waitresses when trying to order but thankfully it was mostly empty and a seat-yourself place. The place has booths along each wall and tables down the middle which is an optimal arrangement. I slipped into a booth and a girl came by and gave me a hard-covered menu. The menu had lines and lines of entrees which I probably won't live long enough to try all of them. I ordered water and beef pho with meatballs. It was excellent. I broke up the greens they give you on the side and drowned them in the broth. The greens added some natural warmth to the noodles which I liked and overall the lime flavor made the whole dish sing. So in the end, I really enjoyed this place and the $10.00 for a bowl of pho and water was a good deal for lunch. I see lots of military there for lunch and for the cherry on the top, there's a newspaper box right outside the front door.",0
Never been there,3
"Last week had a mocha to die for! Normally im very picky about espresso but the macciato and mocha I've had, just heavenly! Ive had just about evey flavor gelato they've put out and I've never been disappointed",0
"I've never been in the store, but I use their carwash. It's a good stop, they also just added a credit card swiper so you can go without quarters, which is a plus.",3
"The got everything, Never been told . sorry we dont have that here.. This business is awesome. Clean , good customer services and friendly..",0
We have NEVER been treated so RUDE! His name is Tony and he said he worked there for 30 yrs. He was working the self checkouts! Very disappointed and he needs to be SPOKE to about Customer service! Thank you!,0
"Clean, Fast and Polite. I enjoy eating at this McDonalds. The restaurant is always clean, bathroom are clean and the kids play area is always clean. I cant comment enough on how refreshing and comforting it is. The food always come out quickly and I have never been disappointed.",0
"Have eaten at this Restaurant over the years and should have said something a long time ago. They have fresh, tasty food. It is always â€œtop notchâ€. Have never been disappointed. The food is great at any meal and the staff are very helpful. Love it!",0
"$$$ Prices Listed Below $$$ If you're looking for a verity of meat and BBQ then you need to visit Texas Roadhouse. Everything here tastes fantastic. The BBQ Chicken Sandwich is my favorite item because it's cheap and simple. The prices here are a little more expensive, so eat all the peanuts you can. The bread rolls with the cinnamon butter are amazing too. The employees occasionally will dance, so that's unique. What I didn't realize is there is an outdoor seating area, but I've never been asked if I want to sit outside. On a sunny day I will request to eat outside next time. Bottomless non-alcoholic (soda & ice tea) drinks here. Impossible to leave here dehydrated! If this review was helpful please click the Like button. April 2018 (1) Grilled BBQ Chicken: $12.99 (1) Pulled Pork Sandwich: $10.49 (1) Pulled Pork Dinner: $12.99 (+) Baked Potato (Loaded): $0.99 (1) Ice Tea: $2.89 Tax: $0.00",3
They really should change their hours. I've only seen it open a handful of times when their hours and online info state otherwise I am writing this review next to their hours of operation and they are supposed to be open until 9am to 8pm but haven't been open at all. I haven't been able to plan a visit due to the place never being open when they say. I suggest going across the street to Heritage or down the way to Udder Culture where their hours are consistent,3
"Never been to this garage, but I pass it all the time on my drive to and from Anchorage",3
I ordered the chicken broccoli stir fry. I have eaten here before. And I have never been disappointed until today. My chicken tasted so bland I almost dont want to eat it.,0
Never been treated wrong here best of the best in the middle of nowhere,3
Best place to go for a person that's never been in the woods or by mountains. It'll do the trick.,3
Subway has never been my favorite sub shop but since there isn't many choices here I'd say go here since they make it as you instruct them etc.,3
"Excellent food! First impression looks a little dingy but don't let that scare you away. The food is flavorful and there's a good quantity. At lunch they have a buffet as well. Service is great and I see a lot of Indians come here so I'm assuming it's authentic, although I've never been to India so I can't verify that.",0
"3 stars is average, 4 stars is above average, 5 stars is they also change the oil in my car while I wait. Pizzeria Roma has been the family pizza place for years now, and we've never been disappointed in the food or service. The highlight of the place is the salads. A half sized salad is more than enough for one person and a full sized can be shared. We went out to Pizzeria Roma for our tenth wedding anniversary, which is the photo I'm attaching. Our youngest loves a selfie.",0
A 3 cause I haven't been there in years but remember a positive experience,0
"The staff and Dr. Todd are very friendly and professional.... Today was my first visit and I already feel 50% better. I've been suffering from lower back pain for over 4 years now, I've seen a lot of Doctors for this issue and they've never been successful in helping me. This is a testament to how knowledgeable and passionate Dr. Todd is, regarding chiropractics.",0
"My favorite restaurant and bar in Anchorage. Since the day I arrived here I have never been bored on going there, is my place to go. Great selection of food and beer, lots to choose from. And the best Tequila Bar in town.",0
"Haven't been in a bike shop in years and was a bit intimidated, all for naught. Everyone there was incredibly kind and helpful, even though I had some stupid questions. Look forward to coming back again!",3
"Absolutely amazing experience! We took our son here for his first teeth cleaning ever and the experience was perfect from the moment we walked through the front doors! With a waiting room full of electronics, then tvs in the exam rooms, my son was entertained! As any 3 year old that has never been to a dentist, he was nervous when he got in the chair, but the dentist let him sit in dad's lap and the dentist talked to him the whole time even though he was crying. It was done in literally 5 minutes, and my son was fine right after. We were in awe with how well the process went and how calm and collected the dentist stayed the entire time.",0
Visited Kobe with my wife after months of being locked up during this pandemic. We called ahead and made a reservation and arrived 15 minutes prior. We waited in the lobby for an hour and 15 minutes until we were able to be seated. I understand that they can only do the best they can to guess and estimate since it's up to the customers as to when they leave. The hostess was very empathetic and the chef was entertaining and delightful. The meals are very consistent and the experience is worth trying if you've never been. Just be open minded if you experience a bit of a wait.,0
"Well, Judy's Cafe is great. I've never been disappointed. This place is always busy. Enjoy the food and excellent atmosphere. I know that I will eat at Judy's again, and again, because it's one of the few places in Anchorage with excellent service and atmosphere for an excellent breakfast. Try it out, you will not be disappointed. Thanks Judy's Cafe! Breakfast was yummy.",0
SUPER long wait!! I've been here for 13 minutes and haven't been acknowledged...while employee talks with other customer. I can here other employees ramble back in forth laughing behind the counter over the ream of paper rack. Too bad those employees can't help out when the counter person is occupied.ðŸ˜ž + 1 * for the counter person being nice after the long wait...,3
"Although the food is decent, im not sure how likely I am to return. The food and the condition of the restaurant do not reflect the same thing. From the front door everything looked fine. It wasnt until we were being seated that I noticed the poor condition of the restaurant. Portions of the floor are coming up (I would've thought it was a design if it was the same all throughout). Most, if not all, of the booth seats are peeled. How can you disinfect the seat when you can see/touch the fabric? The glass divider has dry finger smudges, as if its never been cleaned before. I also found dust/other particles on the divider under the glass.You'd think they'd worry more about appearance for the prices they charge on food. If I was to rate only the food, they would definitely have a higher star rating but after seeing the condition of the restaurant it makes you wonder how kept/clean the kitchen must be.",0
"Haven't been in a while, way better today than it used to be. Hamburger tasted fresh, not nuked to death.",0
Never been there,3
"Since the place burned to the ground, and has been rebuilt the atmosphere has never been as quite as good. But the food still taste great.",0
Not sure I have never been thier,3
"Had reservations for 7pm, and requested a booth in the back. This has never been an issue before today. We arrived at 6:55 and were told that the table was cashing out and it'd be just a few. 25 mins later we watched 3 back booths cleared. We stood there for another 5 while a group of guys with no reservation came in. They said the hostess told them 5 mins. We were then seated right by the men's room up front and watched the no reservation table get seated right in the back. I get that this is Alaska and that customer service means nothing, but REALLY?!? We won't be back and thanks for ruining our anniversary dinner.",0
Never been here before until now can't get enough,3
"After moving here a year ago I haven't been able to bring myself to trust my head to a new stylist. I've found my new home! Go here, you won't be disappointed.",3
Never been,3
Put it this way; if you are just visiting Anchorage for a couple days and haven't been to Moose's Tooth I'd be surprised. If you ask anywhere for advice where to eat they'd tell you MT.,3
i have been going here for along time the food is really good lots of options to choose from however for a first time customer it is very confusing as to what to do and then on top of it the staff should be a little more clear as to what to do how to order and where to pay (see below if u have never been here). the staff is a little rude and standoffish probably due to thefact they are working in a gas station and its early morning that being said this company has good product and good price its may not to die for but if ur looking for a change in ur early morning routine go ahead and give these guys a try u wont be disapointed. i feel as tho the burrito factory would do well to spread their wings and move to a location all their own. new customers: go in to the gas station walk up to the burrito factory place your order take your receipt to the cashier working the gas station pay for it there wait around till they call ur order take the other copy of your receipt that says you paid and give it to the people at the burrito factory,0
"Grew up in a shop, literally, as my father had one. Have worked in many over my 62 years. I can tell a BS shop from the real deal. These guys are the real deal. From north of Anchorage I had to wait while my 4WD had the front end serviced. Wait all blooming day. The auto parts place delivered the wrong part. 2 times in a row. I was there, witnessed it and was there when the third delivery got the right piece. This was Saturday afternoon by this time. They took me in the back, under my vehicle, pointed out the broken or worn out parts while they were still in place first thing that morning. Then during the day they fed me and gave me custom coffee then let me see their chopper projects they had upstairs and hot rod projects downstairs. Not a guy touching a single project all day, just customer vehicles. They also had a number of obvious long time customers come in during the day to pick up vehicles, drop them off or get estimates. Did not see one disgruntled customer the entire day. In short, I will be back to Alaska Spring and Performance for anything they can handle - which seems to be anything. From light service to total frame-off vehicle restorations, transfer case/differential/transmission rebuilding and engine rebuilds or they can get you a crate engine. Not many places like this around anymore. They stopped right when they started on mine as a lady showed up with almost total brake failure. A traveler, they stopped everything to get her vehicle fixed and get her back on the road. They explained to me what they were doing and having been in her shoes I could understand. Now THAT is service. And she had never been there before or even knew it was there. Good shop.",0
Love this place. I always go when I drop of my vehicle at the dealership. Have never been disappointed,0
"Best Sourdough Pancakes I've had in ages! I haven't been impressed the last few times I've been in, but the pancakes and bacon made up for it!",3
"Where to begin? Never been a fan of Pho, until coming here. The portions are easily identifiable, and quite filling. Everything comes out piping hot, and super delicious. I'm not sure if it's a good thing that all the employees knows my family and myself, but I guess that's what happens when you come in repeatedly. Staff is amazing, all are super nice. I have never had a negative experience coming here. I highly recommend the reindeer wantons (spicy and delicious), the number seven (Pho your way, which for me is meatball, brisket and oxtail), the porkchops (number fourteen, toned up) and grilled pork spring rolls. All in all, Phonatik is one of my top places in Anchorage eat. Come in and try it!",0
"Fun little Mexican food outlet, always good, always tasty, always plenty of good food. We have never been disappointed and yes they can deliver !",0
Nice to see Bernies still going strong. Haven't been here in 15 years but aside from being a bit bigger the vibe is still the same.,3
"Waiting for my Lyft when the security guard with the long goatee came out shouting at me about walking about in the parking lot and happening near his truck in the parking lot. Horrible customer service, especially as he knows I'm a paying customer. I've had good experiences here before, but never been shouted at before today. Won't be returning.",0
"I was surprised, having never been to a restaurant like this. Four stars only because they're fairly new and it felt like they were still working out some kinks. The hot pot is hot broth served with thinly sliced frozen meat and vegetables - all ordered separately. There were were other things on the menu as well. I'll definitely try the Bei Jing Hot Pot again.",3
So happy to have Costco. Clean and organized store. Lots of organic options. Good prices. No discount for expiring meat. Only real gripe is the paper straws...they instantly break after one sip. Staff are great and SO polite compared to Walmart. 1/2 of store is home goods and 1/2 is grocery so you may have 2 brand options for each item. And unlike Sam's there have never been long lines. They are doing it right.,0
"Was expecting to get the current TV advertised special. Should have known these are for the Lower 48 only! No wonder I haven't been here for years. Average food. Prices are higher than they should be for average food. Server was very friendly and efficient. Will be many years before I return, again. I can enjoy better food for the same price and not at a chain.",0
Great little park. Haven't been there since I was a kid but I used to skateboard around while my friends played basketball. There's a nice flower garden Parks and Recreation takes care of.,3
"We were charged $50 for a cleaning fee for the community center in our neighborhood. They claimed we spilled things on the wall, left a mess on the microwave, and didn't wipe down table tops. The problem? We had nothing yellow that could have spilled on the wall, we did not use the microwave, and every table used had a table cover on it. Apparently they charge $50 per HOUR to clean, absolutley insane. We followed all of their instructions to clean it (which was a ridiculously long list). Of course we can dispute it, which we are, but we know we won't win. The pictures they sent as ""proof"" don't even show any kind of real mess. The only thing we forgot to do was empty the bathroom trash (it has 2 paper towels in it). So $50 to take out some trash. Haven't been impressed with the customer service either. The few times I have called in, they have been rude. Oh, and how can i forget the fact they gave us the wrong key when we rented the community center. So, they charge $50 if we forget the key but it's fine if they give us the wrong one causing us to wait around for someone to come unlock the door for us ðŸ¤”",0
How do you want to do the customer service in this establishment is very poor it's never been consistent know they are they ever wear their own mistakes and make it seem like the,0
"Vegetable and tofu pad Thai is our go to but I've never been disappointed with anything I've tried! Fast and friendly, highly recommended!",0
"This is a great place for anyone who wants to ice skate to go. The rates and rental fees for open skating are very reasonable. Parking is free. I had never been on ice skates before and it wasn't hard to tell but I used one of the learning aids (looks like a walker without wheels) and I was skating in no time, not great mind you but I stayed upright. I had such a great time with my kids that I can't wait to go back.",3
"I have never been a fan of big box stores like Walmart but, since moving to Alaska a month ago, I have only had positive experiences there. I had to return something today that was a bit complicated but they were super cool about it and refunded me the entire amount I'm cash because I had closed my out of state bank card since making that purchase. They are always very pleasant as well.",0
"It's very dependable Mexican food. Even if you have never been there, you can order any dish from the menu and get exactly what you were expecting.",0
They let go of a good cook and I haven't been here,3
The few times I've been here had a little trouble with a couple of bartenders attitudes nothing major but kind of a whatever you need you don't know what you're talkin about kind of attitude I guess. I'm a bartender and I understand that customers can be a pain I try not to be a pain but when somebody is standoffish or acts like they know better after you identify that you're in the business is kind of irritating. I try to be an easy customer but sometimes in there it seems like pulling teeth. More like you would expect in a nightclub. Trying to keep people in line rather than spending just a moment with a customer and being a little more personal. I think part of the problem is it's a pretty big place but it's still a neighborhood bar. lots of activity in there if you're into that sort of thing and they do have dancing downstairs I heard never been there at night,3
"Great service, never been disappointed with the food.",0
"Had the worst experience here; had a cook pick up another person's food(after serving the wrong food to them) then try serving it to me because the food order was originally mine (mind you the dudes finger were already touching the product)... never been there since... if you do eat here, make sure not to go out on a weekend night here... there busy! Great for drinks tho!",0
"Not one to waste my $$$$ on furs but I see one of the staff on a fairly regular basis and she is very friendly. At the size looking through Windows they have a large selection. I have never been in the door, but window display is great.",0
"I have never, and I mean never been able to find my foundation color. Not only has this woman helped me find it but she also treated me with supreme customer service. I'm certain her name was Teas? Taeas? Tes? Regardless,thank you so much. This is why you are better than ultra. This is why you're amazing. Your service and products are just beyond wonderful.",0
"The esthetics and the music is wonderful. However, this was my first and last time coming to Chepo's. The hostess was abrasive upon entering and just grabbed the menus and started walking to the table without saying anything to my party of six. We followed her unsure if we were supposed to or not. There was not a warm hard off. Once we got to the table, the majority of the water glasses were dirty and we had to request new ones. I thought it was inappropriate and unusual how the workers were shouting things across the room. Only half of the workers and almost none of the customers were wearing masks inside the building. I did not see any major sterilization happening after customers left their tables. Because of all of this, I did not order anything, nor did I eat the complimentary chips and salsa, nor did I drink from the water glasses (I would also like to point out that I absolutely ADORE Mexican food and have NEVER passed up an opportunity to consume its soul satisfying goodness). Once the main dishes came, one of the five plates ordered had a whole sheet of paper in it. Another plate had a whole herb twig in it. When we brought this to the waiter's attention he handled it very appropriately and hastily tried to fix the problem. His customer service was spectacular, even when we asked to speak to the manager. The manager's customer service was NOT up to par. He was defensive from start to finish. He also told us that he, ""Already figured out who it was and slapped them."" He repeated that several times, as though physically assaulting his cook was what we wanted to hear, and would have made the situation better. When we told him about the water glasses being dirty he dismissed it, stating that the waiter didn't tell him that and that it had never been an issue before. When we showed him the twig he said that it was okay because it is edible, as he broke a piece off and put it in his mouth and continued to argue his point. Instead of just apologizing and trying to make it right, he argued and cut us off continually when we were trying to talk. He stated that he has thousands of people come in daily and they have never had issues like this before. Then we come in and, ""Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!"" It was as though he was insinuating that we did things to our own food so that we would not have to pay. He had already taken the charge off of the food with the sheet if paper in it. However, because the rest of the table was thoroughly disgusted by the two different items on the two different plates, paired with the dirty water glasses and lack of masks in the building, they no longer wanted to touch the rest of the food on their plates that were barely eaten. When the table stated they didn't want to pay for the food, but would pay for the drinks the manager argued again and said he would give discounts to the table. The manager only gave $3 off of the meals that were not even halfway eaten. In the end, we left upset and hungry, went on to other more reliable restaurants before our drive back to Anchorage, and out of more money then planned and necessary. Never again, Chepo's. Never. Again.",0
I had never been in their store. All because of a 4 Sale. I will go back,3
"Never been before. Found it very good, quick, & healthy",3
"My husband and I have been living in Anchorage for a few months now and had never been to this diner. You walk in an immediately get the feel of the 1940s and 50â€™s vibe. The music the malt shake bar, the wonderful service from staff. The cook from the kitchen always had a smile on his face. The food was wonderful, I had the chili burger and my husband had the Route 66 burger! Highly recommend.",0
"Absolutely love this cafe â¤ï¸ this is the only place I eat out from since I found out I have celiacs. I have never been cross contaminated here! And the selection is vast and all tasty ðŸ˜ the treats case is well stocked and sooo pretty ðŸ§. Jackson and Em are always super nice when taking and making my order! (And the rest of the staff, I wish I could name them!) I wish I could give this cafe 10 stars because they deserve it! And the I think my favorite part is that my takeout order waste is compostable â˜ºï¸ the gluten free waffles never disappoint. The meze platter is filling, fresh and colorful! And the breakfast sandwhiches have the option to be made into a frittata; have you ever seen that? I haven't! I can't gush enough about this place ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ I'm in love!! ðŸ’•ðŸ’•",0
"Hannah helped me today and she was a fantastic barista. She said she is somewhat new to the profession but she clearly takes her work seriously, the coffee was as good as it looks in the picture! We chatted about the place, which I canâ€™t believe I have never been to before. She praised the owner of 11 years, â€œGatorâ€, for really caring about his customers. The shop is wonderfully eclectic and with a lot of fun paraphernalia on the walls to explore. Star Wars fans are in for a treat! Itâ€™s a really cozy place to bring a computer and work or just hangout and play a game of chess. Now that Iâ€™ve discovered this place, I will visit whenever Iâ€™m in Girdwood.",0
"They got me in the next day with a PA, who was great. I had tests a couple of days later and to make sure I didnâ€™t have to wait all weekend he called me on Friday night to give me the results. Iâ€™ve never been there for anything that wasnâ€™t routine so it was a pleasant experience.",0
"I'm in love. I've never been in a JoAnn's this big. Think your standard fabric store on steroids. It has so many art forms covered that you can surely find something you need. Whether you are a fabric artist, a crafter, a canvas artist and more. This is the place you want to check out.",3
Ok I guess I haven't been there in years,3
"Very nice roomy comfortable boat . Great boat ride, really worth the money. I have never been on a ride that gives you free blueberry donuts, coffee, or tea, plus salmon dip on crackers. This is all through the 3 hr boat ride. Two college students told me they ate about a dozen donuts each! I ate three!. Very nice of the owners, and very good. The trip down the river is fantastic, you can see all the businesses, and homes on the lake bank. Our captain and guide were great, very informative the whole way. Then you also stop at an Indian village which is a lot more good information. We had a wonderful time, and they have a nice gift shop/ restaurant which is very affordable. One tip, I would suggest one of the boxed lunches to eat before, or take on the ship. Lunch has you choice of sandwich, chips, cookie, and a drink for $10.95. excellent lunch, and a great deal! Our thanks to Riverboat Discovery!",0
Never been there.,3
"If you've never been, you have to try the CEO. It's beyond amazing.",3
"I really didn't think I was going to find anything I looked at this store, but I've never been so pleased to be so wrong. Amanda B was seriously the best!! She made me feel comfortable, she listened to exactly what I was looking for (which I didn't even know exactly what I was looking for), and she was super fun. I really can't say enough nice things about her and the wonderful experience she offered me and my ladies. She deserves more than five hold stars for her expertise and quality customer service. Other than that, most of the dresses were just okay. Some of them were spectacular and some of those were even within my price range! Yay for Amanda!!",0

"Haven't been here in a while, glad I came back. Delivery driver was fast, friendly, animated, and called a couple minutes before arrival. Seemed like he enjoyed his job. Pizza was on point and exactly what I had envisioned when I placed the order, a rarity in chain delivery pizza experiences. I will definitely be coming back here.",0
I haven't been here and almost 4 years cause the food was horrible last time. Just went back yesterday and what a disappointing experience. My burger was cook well done and cole just not good the table was gross and ther was fruit flies flying around. How does a place with this much business still have earthquake damage walls. The waitress was not good only check on us one time. This place need a good cleaning.,0

Decent service at drive through. rather disappointed in the food. Have been through here multiple times throughout the day and night. Has never been up to standards of any other taco bell,0
"They were there for me and my dog from beginning, to the end for all 10 years of his priceless company. Many vet clinics feel very corporate and all about ripping cash out of your wallet first, and caring about your pets second. That has never been the case with All Creatures, in my experience, and I highly recommend them.",0
"They've got decent coffee and food, and a great play area for kids so parents can chat and enjoy their coffee while the kids are entertained. My one and only complaint with Auntie's Corner is that each time I've gone, I've never been greeted by baristas, I've always had to announce my presence before being able to order or be greeted. This morning, I came in with my daughter and a friend and her daughter. We loitered around looking at the menu and food items for a good 5 minutes before we announced ourselves and summoned a barista from somewhere unseen. The service here was much better when it was Little Miller's Cafe.",0
"Suite 100 serves my second favorite prime rib in Anchorage, so that is my go to order. I can't recommend their Italian options as I've only tried one and didn't enjoy it, but the steak/seafood menus are delicious. The restaurant is definitely upscale, but I've never been disappointed with my cocktail from the bar. Staff is very attentive and typically friendly.",0
"I don't recall being there 3 days ago, haven't been there for a while, since summer...Nice for the dogs to have a playground!",3
Our favorite place to go whenever we pass through Anchorage. The chicken tortilla soup is my personal favorite. Weâ€™ve probably been here three times now and have never been disappointed. Would recommend for anyone whoâ€™d like some good Mexican food while theyâ€™re in Anchorage.,0
"If you never been here, you HAVE to go.....words cannot describe how truly amazing this place is...",3
"We shared a cheeseburger and fries. Requested they cut it in half. Burger was great. They have new frys (to us, haven't been there in awhile) really liked them. It was neat, clean and very good service. I took blueberry pie home and must admit I won't get it again. It was dry and tough. I'm thinking it might be premade. Please note.. tip on what the total would have been if we had 2 dinners. They work just as hard on 1 burger or 2.",0
"Haven't been to Chili's in a bit since they taken the one out from the valley and we were tax shopping and figured we could splurge. So I hate avocados. Hate them. I had their avocado and jalapeno burger and it was the best thing I've had. But yeah, 5 star, it was good lol",3
Never been to a Texas Roadhouse before and I usually avoid chain restaurants but was pleasently surprised. Party of 13 seated quickly and got our drinks quickly. I got an amazing margarita <3 whole fill got steaks that were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Generous portions and we had a very attentive fun waiter.,3
"Overall nice theater. Prices for the movie are lower then city movie theaters from the lower 48, and only slightly higher then the small town one I went to this spring in Michigan. Folks complaining about concession prices have never been to a theater in a big city in the lower 48.",3
I've never been to a campground before it was right on the ocean where you can see wildlife so readily. All around you is ocean and mountains. This is easy access to the town of Seward and to the highway to reach Anchorage and Beyond. Everything is close by that you will need and it is a truly great place for a camp ground.,3
I quite enjoyed the blt sandwich. The meal came quick and was absolutely delicious. I've never been disappointed here. The staff could use some customer service training. I will go back.!,0
The staff and food is always great here. Never been disappointed.,0
If you haven't been and you live or passing through Anchorage.. stop stop stop and go eat here you will not be disappointed,3
Great food great music awesome family environment definitely suggest if you haven't been that you check it out you want regret it,0
I'm always impressed with the service and quality of the food. I've never been disappointed.,0
"One of the best places I've ever been for breakfast, we go as often as we can. Always consistent with the quality. Can't speak for their lunch or dinner as I haven't been in for either of them, but their breakfast is always a hit.",3
"The hostess was highly unprofessional arguing who was going to work what shift with another worker all while we stood there waiting to pick up our order. Then loudly told another person ""Well you didn't have to take a 20k vacation. Then the wontons we got had nothing in them just the wrapper fried (noticed them after we got home) we called in to let them know and the male hostess tried to convince me a wonton is a fried chip (look it up supposed to have beef, shrimp or pork in them) on top of that I've ordered the same thing each time and its never been a ""Fried chip"" To me that contemplates crappy service if your going to lie to me and not fix the problem. They definitely need to fix their customer service, worse I've ever had there tonight.",0
There was excellent service. I had never been dress shopping at an dress store and a very nice lady helped me find the perfect dress along with shoes and jewelry. I was able to get everything within a matter of an hour. I am very pleased with the service and am planning on get more dresses from them in the future.,0
Never been disappointed here,0
If you haven't been please go an sit in the front two rows. You'll not regret it,3
"This is a horrible place to eat. You will develop health problems and exacerbate preexisting ones. This type of food promotes heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. The only thing positive about this place is convenience, but it should really worry you if you can get a whole meal in under five minutes. Walk away from McDonald's and never go back. I haven't been to a fast food burger joint in over five years. I eat fresh fruits, vegetables and meats daily and I'm happier and healthier than I've ever been. My quality of life has improved exponentially and I spend time with people that I love deliberately cooking health conscious meals. Don't waste your life at these disgusting places.",0
They have never been on time! For what they due if you are 10 mints late it's wrong! Plus they make appts ahead on your time slot! So they are the worst I have ever been to!,3
I did not go in! And it's kinda hard to find the parking lot and the front door. Also The people that work there seem to be unfriendly!,0
"Bad experience both times I tried the food. First tried it when I got here in 2016, and was craving a little korean since its always available near military bases. Got the bibimbap, was extremely disappointed. They use microwaves and you can taste and smell it. When you walk into a restaraunt and you hear that telltale BEEP BEEP BEEP that is a huuuuuge red flag. Decided to try it on a whim again and was equally disappointed. I think alot of people who've never been out of Alaska, or haven't lived outside of Alaska much or at all are used to the quality of food in Anchorage. There are some great restaraunts, to include good korean. Korea Garden is one(HINT: they dont use microwaves) being originally from ""tHe LoWeR FoUrTy EiGhT"" this place like many others(Kavas being one example) is really not great but when you lack quality and have no other option you learn to adjust I guess. I won't ever be eating here again. I know this is typical of asian restaraunts, but the lack of a kids menu is a poor choice as well. If I could leave zero stars I would. Edit: I appreciate the feeback from the owner. I really want to like this place. The idea of fast korean appeals to me greatly but currently I cant recommend this place to anyone who is expecting fast casual korean. I also didnt try the poke as that is not my cup of tea that might be their specialty. I neglected to mention in my review that the kimchi was tasty, and that was the only highlight sadly. Edit2: Owner replied, canned response, wow amazing, ill be back for sure since its obvious my feedback is being taken seriously lmao",0
This place is super cool and I can't believe I haven't been in before. The staff is very nice and helpful.,0
The carpet smells like it has never been cleaned. The food was so so... Cobwebs on some of the chandeliers.. I think it must have been good maybe 20 years ago. ðŸ–“,0
Always pleased with the service and the food during lunch ! I have never been in the evening or weekend however.,0
Never been here. Do not know location of this business.,3
"*Update* I'm sad. I very excitedly went back for dinner because I liked my food so much and my brother wanted to try it. I ordered the Sweet Beef again and it was very yummy like last time, but it was 5 more dollars for dinner and we got less food. Usually dinner costs more because you get a larger portion of food, but the portion size did not change and it didn't even come with the pot stickers that the lunch comes with. I expected like at least an extra scoop of rice, or something, but nope. More money, less food. Also, I ordered the Banana Chips with the Mashed Avocado dip again... and it had no Avocado. I can forgive that because we did get there 25 minutes before they closed and they probably ran out of Avocados, but they didn't even say anything. The food was still very good, and the staff was still really nice, though. I won't be coming back here for dinner, but I'll still be excited for lunch. *Original Post* Broooo... Bomb. Just bomb. We came here for lunch and ordered the Glazed Teriyaki Chicken and the Mr. Asumaia Sweet Beef, with banana chips and mashed avocado dip, and pan fried pot stickers. All of it was so good! Even the water was good! I've been feeling really bored with all the same old eating options and haven't been excited to eat out because of it. So I am so thrilled to find this place! I already can't wait to come back and try more stuff lol. The staff working was really nice too. We stood at the front for about 5 minutes waiting to be seated, but there was only one guy working and he still managed to take our order in a timely manner and popped in at good intervals to make sure we were ok. My ONLY complaint is that they don't have a menu that list their daily specials on which days. And only because I want to know when I can come back and try it all!",0
"The burgers here are so juicy! So far, I've tried the Kenai, Kodiak and Glacier Bleu. I haven't been let down so far! Fast to-go service (15 mins) from time of call to pick up!",0
"Good food. Good service. UPDATE: The food is still good. However, on 2 different occasions after eating here, my hubs ended up having gastrointestinal issues for like 3 days after. We originally chalked it up to being a fluke or something else we ate that caused the problem. We went back a few weeks later and ended up with the same type of gastrointestinal issues for also 3 days. Haven't been back since. Thus the downgrade.",0
Haven't been there for awhile.. still love the food,0
Never been in there before but I'm sure it's great,3
Haven't been there either.....,3
"Went to Tudor HD & they were out of sand paper lol they looked it up & Abbot store had 6 packs! Ran over & none on shelves, Iâ€™m not shy asked an employee & they said theyâ€™ll get someone, they didnâ€™t look honest so I grabbed the ladder & got it myself. While wheeling the ladder other employees saw me but continued ignoring me. Located my item & their count was off by three. Bought them after the self checkout broke. Never been to this one & it soured me on HD all together. They donâ€™t even try to do well.",3
When I go there to get any nuts and bolts I need they got it I've never been told.no we don't have that.the line is long sometimes and they should put another location on eastside.but it is what it is but they got you.,3
"Best Korean in Anchorage hands down. Can't say enough good about the food at hometown. Even with a small staff the service is excellent. I've never been disappointed by anything I have eaten here and the portions are quite substantial. Figure on around twenty bucks a plate, and believe me that's a bargain for what you get.",0
"Corporate sports bar feel, the over priced burger I had was incredibly overcooked and should have never been served. My drink was empty for most of my time there. It wasn't very busy as most of the tables were empty and the entirety of the staff stood behind the bar talking to each other. Skip it",0
My experience has never been phenomenal at this restaurant at this location. The person working the drive-thru window wasn't very into what he was doing so the interaction was quite annoying. Outside of the restaurant needs a good cleaning since the dust and gravel from the winter have thawed and is everywhere. The philly pepper steak sandwich was nothing to brag about. Didn't even look attractive. Flavor wasn't there either but I ate it. I will stick to what they are good at. The roast beef sandwiches,0
"Wynn nature center is an amazing place to visit. There are approximately 1.5 miles of trails on the nature center property that are well cut and easily traversed. Key plants and features are marked with informative signs, and guided hikes are regularly led during the summer months. Across the road from Wynn, they have several more trails that are less traveled, but offer spectacular views. Those trails do have switchbacks and steep portions, so be mindful of your capabilities. The trails on both sides are well worth it. If you find yourself in homer, or even if you are a local and have never been up, take a couple hours to visit Wynn. You will not regret it.",3
"â€œBetter than the viewâ€ The cuisine and service are both phenomenal. They might be only thing better than the view. You get to decide. Either way you are the winner. I have dined here numerous times and have never been disappointed. It's like going to culinary heaven, you don't want to return to earth",0
wow i've never been treated so badly by a medical provider. the nurse had such a bad attitude like she didn't want to be doing the covid tests I was there for. she needs to find a career field it seems!,3
Gas prices are medium. Maybe difficult to get in and out of. New pumps not always working with card reader. Might be fixed. Haven't been in awhile.,3
"I just moved to Anchorage and I love bringing my dog here. I've met some nice people and my dog has made some new friends to play with. Nice, open and fenced in area for dogs to run free. Funny ""tree scarves"" that someone has knitted on the trunks of trees. However, a downfall would be the homeless, drug addicts in the park that frequently gather here. Never been a problem for me (yet) but still a little worrisome.",3
I never been there except for next at the pioneer lodge,3
Never been there!,3
"Idk why I'm writing a review for Carrs in Palmer. That town has basically no grocery stores. Fred Meyer and Carrs is it. If you haven't been to them, I'm not sure what to tell ya. 5 stars.",3
"Great coffee, very friendly service, and quick too! Love this place. I've ordered everything from mochas to lattes, and smoothies. I have never been disappointed.",0
"There is a lot to like about the Grape Tap. Most times I have been there, the food has been great. When it wasn't great it was still good. The menu is interesting and I try something new each time. I have never walked away from there thinking ""I could have done it better at home"". I don't drink, so I can't help you with wine and spirits end of GT. The Grape Tap is worth a try if you have never been. I don't go often, but it is a place that I have no reservations about going back to.",0
"I used to really enjoy this place but last time I was there they were a little spendy & didn't have any specialsðŸ˜ž I haven't been GVS for a while tho, not sure what the hours are anymore? Since covid it just stresses me out trying to figure out who Is open when anymore .",3
Had never been here and knew nothing about it. Went in with both my kids and waitstaff was wonderful with them. Food was amazing. Flavor combinations that I would not think would work but... they do and they work well. I will definitely return.,0
"I had the happy accident of finding Rebecca on Groupon 5 years ago. I've never been anywhere since. The cleanliness, knowledge and professionalism offered at Face Forward are second to none.",3
Excellent sushi. I have been several times and have never been disappointed.,0
My youngest wanted to go there since she has never been. She was entertained by our chef and enjoyed the creativity!!,3
"They went above and beyond to help us with our very injured kitty ""Stormy"". They were kind, understanding, and patient with us. I've never been treated so well at a veterinary clinic. Our kitty is back home and he is going to make a full recovery!",3
I've enjoyed their sandwiches for quite some time now. Very delicious. I tried their dinner menu for the first time tonight and I am blown away with the pinsa pizzas! I've never been to Italy but you can taste and smell the authentisity of this food. It is a unique experience for this Alaskan.,0
"Haven't been to this location in the PX for awhile now bcuz at one point there was a girl there who was rude, inconsiderate and could not get my drink made right. Other employees was usually nice however.",3
Super sweet and quick! I haven't been happier than going to Coastie's since I've been in town.,3
Never been here once and I go to this school,3
"I really enjoy walking with our two small breed dogs. They do have sections that allow dogs without leashes (speak more on this down below) but we didnt and dont do that just incase. They have garbage bins all through out the trails and doggy bags to CLEAN UP AFTER UR DOG! Their are benches throughout the trails and beautiful spots for photos. Lots of Beaver activity so be careful. The 1 or 2 drunks that sometimes linger, Ive never been bothered by them though. They have a trail thatâ€™s paved for bikers/easy walking, or dirt trail closer to the lake too. My main grip about coming to the park is the dog leash free area should be for behaved dogs only! Thats sounds obvious right well just about everyday in our daily walks there is a dog(s) that donâ€™t listen to the owner when being called to get back from us and our dogs. We have two toy sized dogs that cant defend themselves are on leashes, being trained and other dogs push their chests out and growl and I try to tell the dog to get back with no results. So I end up picking my dog up and having to teach the owner a lesson on owning pets and having them obey or stay on a leash. And the whole park ISNâ€™T leash free zone but people cant read I guess.",3
Never been there,3
"I would say it's the nicest cigar shop in Anchorage, but it's generally not a big cigar town so that isn't saying much. I know they also have a semi-secret smoking lounge a couple doors down but I have never been in it.",3
"Haven't been there since they added the plushy seating. Was impressed and comfortable, even with the outside temperature at -15...",3
I just went to Chili's there I've never been any place in the mall yet but it looks like a great mall lots of stores,3
"I have debated about whether or not to report the way I was treated when I recently rented a car from the AVIS rental in Anchorage Alaska Airport. Our flight was delayed into Anchorage by about 2 1/2 hours (however, it was delayed by 15 mins at a time, making it impossible to know exactly when we would land). I had selected a 7pm pickup time, but it was about 9:30pm when we got in line to pick it up. The attendant at the counter said they gave our car away since we didn't show up at 7. She offered to give us an upgrade for an additional charge, which didn't seem fair and would cost us more money than we had budgeted for our trip. We asked to see the supervisor to see if they could waive that fee since they gave our original rental to someone else without contacting us. The supervisor was very rude and offered no options other than paying for an upgrade or waiting another hour for them to see if they could get another car. After about 15 hours of traveling, I was exhausted, and muttered to my husband that I would just pay the difference and mention it in my review. The manager overheard me, walked over, and said ""If that is how it is going to be, I'll just cancel the reservation."" I told her no, I still want the car and she literally said, ""TOO BAD. You already said you'll leave a bad review, so I already cancelled it."" I said, ""Please don't do that. I need the car."" She said, ""Maybe someone else will give you a car. She yelled over to the next counter and asked if they had a car and they said ""no"". I asked multiple times if I could just take the upgrade and the supervisor VERY rudely, in a nasty tone of voice, kept saying, ""NO! I'm not giving you a car now."" I eventually started crying because our long awaited birthday trip was being wrecked by a thin-skinned mean employee who was overreacting to a comment that wasn't even made to her, and was a mild comment, at that. After myself being wronged, I literally began to cry and beg (a humiliating experience that a customer should NOT have to face), asking if there is any way she could just let us have the upgrade and pay the full price and I wouldnâ€™t write a review. We were completely at this woman's mercy, and she was enjoying the power trip. She said, ""Hold on"" in a very short, snippy voice, then went back into the office for a while, and came back out. She put the papers in front of me and had me sign, saying only 2-3 words. When we left we received no ""thank you"" , no apology for giving our original car away without contacting us, or anything of that nature. I seriously couldn't believe how we were treated. Never in my life have I seen a customer service employee on a power trip like this; cancelling our reservation because of a comment from a weary traveler to her husband about mentioning something in a review. Not to mention, they canceled our original reservation when we were only 2 1/2 hours later than the pickup time, which is probably EXTREMELY common at an airport. Plus I had to enter our flight info when I booked the car, so they could have seen that our flight was delayed. I literally went to my hotel room and cried myself to sleep that night. It was such a long weary day, and what was supposed to be an exciting trip we had planned and budgeted for all year, was began on a terribly sour note. The whole situation was stressful and completely unnecessary. Forevermore, the Avis logo will make me shudder. I hadnâ€™t planned to write a review of this experience, because I had promised the woman I wouldnâ€™t. However, the more Iâ€™ve thought about it, the more I realize I should have never been bullied into that promise to begin with and I donâ€™t want anyone else to be treated this way just because I failed to report what was done to me. I do want to say that when we dropped the car back off, the employee that received it was the most kind human, in harsh contrast to the supervisor we met upon pick up. This one deserves the job of supervisor. Maybe his attitude would be catching. If I had only experienced him, this would be a five star review.",0
I've never been able to stick to a work out consistently or at all. I would get to the gym and remain clueless. These instructed one hour work outs with high accountability help me push myself to MY limits based on my own heart rate monitored on the leaderboard. I'd give this new locally ran business a try because the first class is free and there's no year long contract to buy out if you decide it's not for you.,3
"I've tried to buy a car from Lithia Chevy three times. Twice I've gone in and haven't been able to get someone to help me. One time it was Sunday and I was told a lot of salesmen take Sundays off, so everyone was busy. The other time I was looking for a used truck and since none of them had prices listed I had to go inside, where I waited for 30 minutes for a salesman before I decided to leave. The receptionist was nice, at least. Both of those times I bought vehicles elsewhere. Last week I called looking at a specific truck, and I gave the salesman the stock number from their website. He couldn't find it for a few minutes, and when he finally did find it he didn't know anything about it. I mentioned that I might be purchasing it as a business and he immediately got defensive and told me that he would pass me along to their commercial salesman. I said ok, and he started talking to someone else and left me sitting on the line for 5 minutes listening to his conversation before hanging up on me. I gave him my name, email and phone number, but this was a week ago, and I still haven't heard back from anyone there. I bought a Chevy in the meantime from somewhere else, so it's their loss, I guess.",3
"I've left my car here at Mike's for the long term airport parking. It has never been messed with and Mike operates on the honor system when it comes to payments. Super nice guy, great location.",3
Cheap and fast! Never been diappointed,3
Greatest Mexican food in town... if you've never been here your missing out.,0
Humm starting to wonder about all these parks i have never been to,3
"We took our 6 y.o. & he loved it. I would have enjoyed playing a few more holes (my only reason for 4 stars) For the little one, it was just right -- he was done after the last hole so no meltdown. I have never been here before, but we met the new owner -- she & her staff are very friendly. We will be back again soon, winter is coming. ;)",0
"We've been several times and never been disappointed! The menu is varied from healthy (they make their own granola and will substitute egg whites if you like) to classic pancakes and biscuits and gravy. I love that if there's a wait, which is always the case on a weekend they have a coffee station set up in the front so you can at least have a warm cup of coffee or tea. The staff are eclectic and friendly. I plan on being a regular. There is also an espresso bar, juice bar, and after 10am they sell adult beverages.",0
Beware of take out. My home is five mintues away from their Abbot location but they've never been able to deliver in less than an hour. They always say they get lost...I dont have this problem with any other delivery places.,3
Have never been to Muldoon Pizza.,3
Iâ€™ve been coming here for a few years and have never been disappointed with any of the hairstylists Iâ€™ve had.,0
"Looks expensive never been there, but would love to!",3
Riding with some one but never been there to hang,3
"Got to go with someone who had never been - had to introduce the classics. Bloominâ€™ onion with special sauce is always delicious and fresh. The bread and creamy butter is a staple of the restaurant as well. Staff is friendly and accommodating - seemingly dressed like park rangers lol. I got a petite sirloin and they cooked it how I requested, they slightly over cooked my friends Ribeye though. The coconut shrimp were big and delicious, and the lobster tail looked perfectly cooked (friend got it), as well as they said the ribs were fall off the bone and scrumptious.",0
By far one of my favorite dispensaries. The atmosphere is awesome and their employees are amazing!!!! I e never been disappointed,0
Never been Here,3
Never been there,3
"Definitely the best sushi I've tried in the area. Don't judge a book by its cover when parking at the location. At least walk in and see the place transform into a elegant evening. I'd say a way to impress a date, especially if they've never been. With the attire of business ava business casual; Just say trust me prior to walking in.. Then watch their eyes change over as they enter... They'll look at you like you actually know something. Loved the experience here. Gorgeous establishment",0
"I have only worked directly with Warren and Lai, so I can speak to my experience with them. Iâ€™ve never been to a more professional or over-the-top caring business as the one they have. Warren definitely cares a lot about his customers and wants to do EXACTLY what you want and pays very close attention to detail. Heâ€™s very professional, yet personable. Lai works really hard in making sure you feel taken care of and goes the extra mile to accommodate you and follow up afterwards. I will only go here for my tattoos from now on and I donâ€™t mind how long the wait might be. Itâ€™s worth it.",0
I haven't been to Subway in a long time last time i went there the customer service and food was really good!,0
Had never been here before but it's a nice little get-away and is really peaceful.,3
They let go of a good cook and I haven't been here,3
"I preface this review with that I have never been white water rafting therefore had no idea what to do or expect. Shuttle was late for the pick up from the hotel, not like 2 or 3 minutes late, like 30 minutes late. So much so that we called them to see if we missed it but we were informed they were just running a little behind. We were told this was normal of them by our hotel. Next, did you know you needed waterproof gloves? I didnâ€™t but good thing they sell them in the office (expensive) but would have liked to know seeing how I had them at the hotel. Then we were told that if we didnâ€™t complete the online checkin there was a place to complete it. I found this funny since we were never given the option for online checkin. The front desk staff was rude and disorganized. Then I got in a dry suit that was wet inside and was told this was normal. After all this I almost just canned the whole trip but it was bucket list and I was in Alaska. So why am I telling you all this? Get past the registration, pick up and checkin process (which was awe full) and go on the trip you will not be disappointed. Cody was our guide and he did such a good job, we were laughing and a bit freaked out in spots the whole way. We did the Healy and it was such a great time. Jumped in the water and swam, why not your on a freezing cold river in Alaska. Loved how all the guides had swim trunks over their dry suits it made it easy to identify them. Overall a great river trip. Then you get back to the office to get back to your hotel. Disfunction again. Expect a great trip in the river, the rest of the process could use some reorganization.",0
"This place continuously slides to being more mediocre over time. Pretty average food, often not that hot. Service is lack luster. I know they can do better, because they used to. What happened to the tempora rock fish? They've never been able to do good fries, which is weird. And they use some strange chemical flavored whip cream on desserts. That said, it's a good location. And you know what you'll get out of the place.",0
Excellent atmosphere and otherworldly food. I would come back to Alaska just to visit this place it was so good. I definitely harbor major regret in my life and have trouble sleeping because I did not visit this place more than once while I was in town.,0
Love this place. Awesome food and always fresh. Been coming here for a few years now and I've never been disappointed. It's pretty affordable too which is great for my college pockets.,0
"This place is absolutely wonderful. I've lived here for the better part of my life and I've never been here once. My wife and kids were treated like family as soon as we walked through the door. The food was amazing and beyond expectation. Customer service was phenomenal. We had hot coffee refilled right on time as well as our waters. We had friendly conversation with the staff and manager, who by the way is a very nice lady. Needless to say we were pleased with the place from the food to the customer service and we will be regulars. A side note to my battles, they are military friendly and offer a discount.",0
Have tried several things on the menu over the past few years and Iâ€™ve never been disappointed. Great spot for Indian food.,0
"It's Kinkaid. It's awesome. If you haven't been, go. If you have, then you already know. I recommend a Yeti dog.",3
We've been to two of their Fall Festivals. It's a good time walking around and usually not too crowded. Plenty of stuff to do for the kids. We haven't been to the Summer or Winter festivals.,3
"Another cold stone, if you haven't been before you they have 15 or so ice creams to choose from and anything you can think of to mix in! Delicious! Only complaint is sometimes they're understaffed.",0
"I cannot thank this office enough for their professional and kind demeanour and true compassion. The entire staff is amazing and the doctor is so intelligent and knowledable about dentistry. I have never been to a medical or dental office this exceptional. In years past, I was treated terribly at BTYW clinic, a secondary office associated to them, and then a very awful experience (s) at ALCAN. I was left with bad memories and apprehension all together to finding another dental provider. I was actually scared to even go to Anchorage Dental the day of my first appointment and was instantly made to feel safe and the ladies at the desk were so nice and sweet. As well, the hygienist and everyone. My doctor (dentist) addressed the concerns and did what all these other places failed to provide in the past 2 years. He was so on mark and did not mess around. I almost cried going home because I was finally validated that it was not me or my imagination that the former care I had received before coming here, was in fact horrible. I want to thank Anchorage Dental Group for restoring my faith in dentistry and for helping me get fixed what the other places did not address properly. I will refer only them to friends, family and the community in the future. You will not regret coming here. My gratitude is deep and again, thank you Anchorage Dental Group.",0
"I haven't been to Applebee's in years because I really can't afford to eat out much, but the food was pretty good, and they have half off full size appetizers at night, or deals for smaller sizes, which is what my party had. The service here is good. I would go back.",0
Very dirty inside. Floors look like they haven't been cleaned in days. We walked out,3
"One of my favorite places in town to eat. They have a great variety of food; from vegan & gluten free, to a delicious cheeseburger. I've never been disappointed. The coffee and baked goods are always on point, and the variety and uniqueness of the smoothies is killer. I usually get the soup of the day and a sandwich. Yum",0
"I love this place. Their Cinnamon Chip bread is scrumptiously delicious. They give free samples of their breads, and the samples are full slices of bread, not just a bite. If you haven't been there, treat yourself. The fresh baked bread, along with their coffee, cookies, sandwiches, and other little goodies, are definitely worth the trip.",0
I have never been to this location. However I called them and asked what type of vegetable starters they have and the lady on the phone sighed heavily and said she has no idea what she has but they have lettuce. Terrible customer service from this experience. You should be eager to help all customers and ready to answer questions. You should also know enough about your inventory to tell someone more than â€œ we have lettuce â€œ.,0
"So I see alot of 1 stars and alot of 5 stars, I'll just say this, the reason those people are giving it a good rating is because favoritism plays a huge factor with this business, I owed 800.00 that I didn't even know about. That being said when me and my girlfriend moved to another part of town, we found out the building we moved into is ML&P not chugiak electric, which was kind of a disappointment, as me and my girlfriend never liked ML&P, when we moved we couldn't put the electricity in my name due to a bill I owed well over 10 years ago. ML&P is also a company that uses strong arm tactics to get your money. My girlfriend tried to put it in her name but they wouldn't let her, we we're told to go to cornerstone and pay this 800.00 bill that came out of nowhere. Yes I am also saying I believe they are partner companies. Cornerstone credit has never been professional and the same goes for ML&P. The thing is, cornerstone never attempted to contact me, for 10 years, I had this bill just waiting for me, and that day came when we moved. We payed it. Hopefully, and I mean hopefully with strong intension, I don't have that happen again.",3

Food has never been other than fair,0
Never been in there before but I'm sure it's great,3
"I needed coolant for my Polaris ATV and some Stihl equipment. I went to purchase a $720 backpack fogger (SR 450), $650 backpack blower (BR 800 C-E) and a $650 FS240 trimmer for my business. I spent about 5 minutes waiting for somebody in sales to come help, which they didn't. The Stihl ""desk"" was unoccupied, but there were numerous sales folks walking around waxing motorcycles or playing on their phones. I then went and pulled down the FS 240, put the harness on, adjusted it, made more adjustments, attached the trimmer, and walked around to see how the weight was distributed and how comfortable it was. In hindsight, I probably should have swung it around the motorcycles that may have got their attention. At this point, I started to really notice how little they cared about the Stihl brand within their store as 2 other sets of people had come and gone by the time I had danced around with the trimmer and accessories. I had spent almost 20 minutes in the store, looking at the equipment that I wanted to purchase (They didn't have a backpack fogger). I then grabbed the coolant and went to the parts counter and paid. During the transaction, I was asked ""Did you find everything you needed?"" I replied that I had spent far too much time waiting for somebody to assist me, so I was going to go else ware. The counter guy offered to see if he could find somebody, to which I declined. I have been disappointed by the Outpost, and have used the dealership in Delta as the only place I will purchase Polaris vehicles from in Interior Alaska. I only went to the Outpost because I needed coolant AND Stihl equipment. They had both. I was told by the parts guy that the Stihl ""salesman"" actually works at Fort Knox Gold mine, this was a ""part time"" job for him when he wanted to come in, and that he didn't know much about the equipment anyway. The Outpost touts themselves as the farthest north blankity-blank dealership in America. But, that is the only thing they have going for them. I have never been impressed with their customer service or their service department. (I spent almost $350 for them to tell me my fuel pump was bad, diagnosis only, no repair). I have purchased Stihl and Honda small engine equipment (Chainsaw and Generator), but that was because I was new in town and was willing to accept sub-par customer service as the norm. But, after being here in Fairbanks for 10 years, I've learned that sometimes the little shops are the ones that shine, the glitzy dealership on the highway is based solely on their exclusivity of some brands. The equipment I need to pay the bill is available elsewhere, and most all manufactures offer ""Nationwide pricing"" so, going someplace with big windows and shiny motorcycles isn't going to save you any money. Go to the little guys. As far as weekend toys, I have NEVER been disappointed by going to Delta (I live in North Pole, so it doesn't seem THAT far to save a thousand or so dollars vs. these guys). I know this was long, but after 10 years of not having anything positive to say about the Outpost, I feel I have the clout to post a long winded and factual track record experience with the Outpost. I fully expect to see a reply from their ""customer service rep"" stating ""We are sorry for bla-bla-bla, we pride ourselves in bla-bla-bla"". Well Outpost, after 10 years of sub-par customer service, I can fully feel justified in saying, Fairbanks is known for its sub-par customer service, but you get first place for poor customer service. (We are sort of an island here in Fairbanks, Sub-par seems standard in Fairbanks...) The Outpost only has their exclusive brands that carry the weight and ""force"" that brand of customer to go there. I'll visit for fluids, order my hard-parts from online Polaris dealers, purchase my Honda small engine from either the Wood Way (I have some opinions about them), Sportsman's Warehouse (Generators and their Military discounts!) or Craig Taylor for Honda small engine and Stihl equipment.",0
"I've never been disappointed in the food here, even though it is a bit pricey for thr experience of sharing a table with strangers (unless you bring a group large enough to fill a table). But the amount of time between being seated and when the chef shows up to cook is ridiculous and makes me dread going here most the time. Also, the service in general can be iffy, though the chefs have always been on point.",0
"Tori, the GM, and her crew are awesome. True professionals! Customer service like this is hard to find anymore. The best sandwich shop in Alaska! If you have never been there, you are really missing out.",0
"Usually a decent place to pickup the usual. Not a spectacular selection but local options are available. Pricing is always fair. I live nearby so often show up if I need some beer or wine. Unusual encounter earlier this evening though. For the first time ever I was met an hour before posted closing by a security employee who has never been there before that denied me entry. I am a good customer,(spent 145 today in groceries) not a vagrant and local who buys many groceries at the the Carrs as well. He immediatly denied me entry despite other shoppers inside during normal posted business hours. He was polite but stern and gave his name as Daniel. I am sure he was doing as told but I do not appreciate as a regular having a new guy tell me I cannot frequent my regular place of business. I work in customer service and would be risking my job acting in such a manor.",0
"Likely some of the best barbecue pork spare ribs in Anchorage.... possibly Alaska, and I'm not joking. Also, the potato salad is fantastic. The price is definitely reasonable and I highly recommend that you check this place out. I've never been disappointed in all the years that I've picked up food from AJs. The only real downside is that they don't take credit cards, or at least they didn't the last time I checked. They only take cash. That's just something to keep in mind if you pull up there. If you pull up and you want a decent size dinner for two people, expect to pay about $40 so.",0
Got stuck in Eagle River during that overpass accident with the truck never been in here before people are very nice fast service basic Mexican food I'd go back,0
Never been there,3
Never been here but freaking a five star baby,3
"Haven't been to every dispensary but this is by far my favorite one. Not only do they have great smoking and edible options, but they also have awesome merch and salesmen",3
Service awesome! Food is the best! Haven't been disappointed yet! Fresh and so good!,0
I haven't been there in a while but the food have not change as well as the flavor. Still pretty greasy anything fried.,0
"I haven't been here in a long time, decades. No it wasn't that bad, I live in a different part of the state now. It was very nice to come back.",3
Haven't been in a while and thr software of thr bowling is super cool. Doing there part for masks and distancing.,3
5 to 7 is half price appetizers. I've never been disappointed.,0
If you haven't been here yet than you're not a local. Easily the best Italian food in town which is saying something because we have a strong Italian food scene. Great family owned business with some amazing food!,0
If you haven't been here I suggest you try it,3
"My daughter and I love red Apple! They have absolutely everything in there! They have prell, they have finesse shampoo! I haven't been able to find finesse shampoo since I was in high school in 1993. They have everything everybody super night I super love it when they have coupons!",3
Super friendly staff. Something special about the way they cook vegetables. Great porkchops and desserts. Second time here and haven't been disappointed in anything.,0
Never been inside but drive through does alright.,3
Haven't been to Chepo's in a while. Still awesome food and service. Looking forward to our next visit,0
So much fun. Too bad we did not visit during winter with snow on the ground. Loved the surrounding birch forest. Jasper was a favorite. So fun to walk with reindeers in the woods. Glad we did this since there was not much for us to do this time of year (Sept 2018). Tourist season is ending. But glad we made this reservation.,0
"Very delicious foods and personable service! I tend to order the same things at restaurants since I know what I like, it's difficult to try other things on the menu, but I did with the help of our server. Haven't been disappointed by anything yet.",0
"Buy the bun for $5, truly amazing. The sugar rush still has me shaking. Thereafter, the highlight and I kid you not, was the toast! I've never been impressed with toast before. Maybe it's because the omlette was dry and undesirable. The pancakes were uninspiring. There you have it, sugar rush buns bigger than a mountain, and toast. I wanted to go back, but my doctor said if I went back just one more time that I'd immediately get diabetes and die!",3
"The campsites are very nice and spacious. Being right across from the airport, we have only heard a couple of planes. The staff has been very friendly, and being right on the river makes for a perfect experience!",0
"This is my favorite thrift shop! Cute decor, awesome finds at great prices. I love that they play Christian music(I may have been caught singing while shopping!).The staff are always super friendly and upbeat. If you you haven't been to their shop, you need to check them out!",0
Never been there but I like ice cream.,3
Haven't been here in years.... what an AWESOME turn around this place has made. Dined here with a friend who has traveled the world and he swears it's the best restaurant in more than just Alaska. Excellent food and wine selection. Appetizer menu was superb. I wanted to order 1 of everything and could have dined just doing that alone. Total thumbs up.,0
Haven't been able to use services ever since the staff accused me of smoking spice. It used to be a good place to get breakfast and lunch and to do some community service. But since there discriminatory decision about me and I'm disabled they are lucky I decided to leave peacefully and did not set a law suit on them for abusing me and lieing about me.,0
I have gone here for multiple repairs and I have never been disappointed. Reggie is awesome and very helpful!,0
"always polite, helping a busy mom out. my order has never been wrong!",3
"I like Arby's, occassionally. The brisket bacon cheddar is very tasty! It has good customer service at the window. Never been in to eat.",0
"Clean, manicured, beautiful most importantly, it didn't stink! It was a great area for the fur baby to run and play. Recepticals for waste and bags are supplied. I've never been before, but I'll be going back for sure!",3
"I haven't been to that many restaurants in Homer, but I haven't been disappointed with any of them so far. Fat Olive's was a good experience; they had good service, ambiance and food. We got the meatball appetizer and two of their pizzas and everything tasted great and was cooked well. I also found their dough to be especially tasty, which I feel like is a big part of making a really good pizza. I suppose if I had to find a fault with this place, it would have to be their lack of waiting space. This probably wouldn't be an issue normally, but with Covid restrictions, you had to wait outside or in your car.",0
Great food. As advertised. My server was Super sweet and helpful. I had Never been to a Korean barbeque before but i sure was full when i left. It was great. I went with a level 3 out of 10 spicy and it was still pretty warm. But if you really like spicy you are gonna get what you want out of this place.,0
"Now I must say I was skeptical about the fun a bingo hall could provide because I have never been to one before. Once you get in there you see how excited people are to spend time with those they care about, popping pull tabs, and playing bingo; it is infectious for sure. Before you know it, your playing multiple cards like a pro. This place has a good feel with very polite staff members and helpful patrons, I will definately be going back here again soon.",0
"Maybe I get the wrong stuff. Maybe Iâ€™m just not feeling the breakfast hype over expensive eggs. Either way, Iâ€™ve never been impressed by the food and Ive always been mega hungry when I get to sit down following a huge wait (avg 45min). Again, maybe Iâ€™ve been super unlucky the few times Iâ€™ve gone. Service is quite pathetic for price point. I honestly wouldnâ€™t recommend. Breakfast shouldnâ€™t be this complicated.",0
My absolute favorite place to eat in Fairbanks. In the summertime they have lovely outdoor seating seating right on the Chena River. Iâ€™ve gone her 6-7 times for dinner and once for brunch and Iâ€™ve never been disappointed with the food or service. Iâ€™d actually recommend making a reservation because this place always seems to be busy and can fill up. Bottom line: if you were in Fairbanks one night and wanted a place to eat that would give you a high quality experience of Alaskan cuisine Iâ€™d tell you go to the Pumphouse.,0
"It's BWW, the food has never been outstanding and the customer service could be improved upon.",0
Great food and a great staff. I've never been disappointed when I go here.,0
If you have never been 2 a Cabela's store it's where the Cabela's magazine comes 2 life.If it's not there you don't need it. Like going to Disneyland 4 sports enthusiasts. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,3
I had one of the best customer service experiences here! I haven't been here in forever and just went through the drive through with people who were kind and friendly.,0
"We recently switched over to Soldotna Animal hospital a few years back after using both other vet offices in town and we have never been happier. The knowledge, friendly staff make the process of bringing your pets in easy and enjoyable. Both vets are highly knowledgeable, relatable and friendly making understanding anything you need to know about your pet easy to comprehend. We love everyone there and have never been happier with our switch :)",0
Never been there before but I need to go and get my sideburns done I'll tell you then and give you a more fair assessment right now at 3,3
"Their food is incredible! I've never been disappointed! Service is fast, and always with a smile!",0
Never been there before this visit. Will plan to stay here again. There is an in-hotel spa service available. The staff is welcoming and courteous. Thanks for awesome service.,0
"The food has never been great. But they're close to work and decent enough for a quick bite. But after this last experience I would give zero if I could... myself and my two co workers tried calling and we were told they were busy at the the moment, could not take our order and to call back in 10 minutes (noon). We called back 2 times with no answer (12:20) and then they had us place our orders and we were told they were too busy to run 2 credit cards and had to order somewhere else (12:30) We wasted 30 minutes of our lunch hour waiting on them, only to be told we couldn't order.... ridiculous.",0
I have never been so comfortable with a stylist on my first visit..what a great time and a positive atmosphere with an experienced family business ! Not to mention my haircut and style !! I didnt have enough business cards to hand off to friends .ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ There will be great hairstyles all over the penninsula ! The price was Great! Thank you HeadHunters and youre awesome talent,0
Expensive and not worth it. I ordered a chicken salad for $18 which was so chewy it made my jaw sore until the next day. Didn't get my money back and I barely ate it. I haven't been here in years and figured I would try it out...big mistake,3
Haven't been there yet ! Can't give it a rating. Before summer. I'll get in there,3
"Super nice, never been before. Will definitely make a return trip.",3
Always comfortable and fun... for days and evenings at least. We haven't been in late night so can't speak to that.,3
Have never been disappointed coming here.,0
"The atmosphere was great. They have a country and hip hop side with pool tables, jenga and darts. The country music they played was on point and I really enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't care for about this place was the entrance. I have never been frisked so violently and thoroughly without notice it took me by surprise and I felt that they should at least notify you before you are touched. It didn't help that all I brought was my military ID and they said they would not allow me entrance without another form of ID. Which in my mind that makes absolutely no sense it's a federal ID with my picture on it how much more real can it get. I can understand there reasoning to a point that some soldiers pass their ID to someone else. However, the same thing goes for any form of ID so I didn't feel like that was a justifiable reason. Side note I am 30 years old and pretty clearly over 21. So just be aware that the frisking is no joke and bring another form of ID.",3
"I've been renting from National for many years and am usually satisfied. Sign up for their membership and pay for a midsize vehicle while getting any vehicle that's available in the Emerald Aisle when you arrive. I've never wanted in line to pick up a car and haven't been too disappointed by the available vehicles. The couple of times we've run into issues they were quick to resolve it. For the most part the customer service is great, especially when dealing with the staff at the airports. I've not had to deal too much with the phone reps so not sure how well that's all handled.",0
This girl told me I'd get 20% off my order today if I signed up for the card. So I ran all the way over to Kohl's to grab my purse. Came back it didn't go thru. So I didn't get 20% off. So she lied to me.... ugh,0
"Havent been here in quite a while, there is too much theft from vehicles in the parking lot. Saw plenty of security in the mall which is nice. The new Dave and Busters is open, cant wait to check that out soon. Mall was clean and not overly crowded with teenagers. I visited the theater (3D movies are not as good as they sound), Pac Sun clothing, Bill a Bong ( nice 50% off sale), and the shoe store for flip flops. Best buy also got me for a good bit of money. I would give 5 stars if they could ever get the crime out of the parking lots...",0

"Went to get a hair cut at ulta for the first time. My friend told me that she loved going their so I set up an appointment online for a cut and style with Monah. When I got there the lady at the register said she was running behind and would page me when she was ready. I heard my name called so I went to the front desk. But I think the lady was on her way out so she just told me to have a set in a chair. Their was hair still all over the floor from the last person but she still had me sit there. Mohan washed my hair and started the hair cut. She didn't talk much and disnt ask if the cut in the back was to short. ""It was"" she straightened my hair to finnishe the cut. She didnt really style it at all. When I got to the register to pay she said it would be 66. But online it said 55. And their was a sign that said 1st time customers get 20% off there hair cut. But she said straightening my hair cost extra. But no one told me that. She never said anything. So she called a manager up. But the hair salon manger left for the day. So this lady had no idea what was going on. Monah took off the 11 is cost to straighten my hair and told me that someone should have told me before the hair cut that it was extra. She didnt give me 20% off and acted like she did me a favor by taking off the 11 dollars. It was just a bad experience. I will not go back there.",0
